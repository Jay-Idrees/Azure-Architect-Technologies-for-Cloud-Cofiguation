# Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies for Cloud 

I have created this repository as my go-to self reference for Azure Architecht technologies certifications

## Powershell

- It is a command line interface for administrating Azure environment

- **Azure PowerShell** is an extended version of Microsoft-extended Powershel - Allows you to interact with Azure Environment via **Azure Modules**. These azure modules are a set of commands that configure a certain task such as configuring a virtual network, subnet etc. The convenience is that you can run a specific Azure Module through powershell and it will automatically configure it. 

- The requirements for installing Azure Powershell is that you have the latest versions of win basic powershell and .NET Framework- See below to check which versions you have

- Check which default version is available for powershell in windows by opening it and typing `$PSVersionTable` in the terminal. This commands give a bunch of details. You can be even more specific with `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`. Keep powershell up to date- current version is 5.1. If you need to install use [Latest Powershell version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.1#powershell-core)

- You should also have the updated version of **.NETframework** - It is a webapp framework that is used to build online software. You can use powershell to check the version with the following commnd:

- `(Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full").Release -ge 394802`  where `-ge` is greater than or equal to. This is like going to the registry with `regedit` and then navigating to the path and locating the version. 394802 corresponds with .NET Framework version 4.6.2 or later and is the release key. Each version has its own release key, for example 528040 is the release key for .NET Framework 4.8. A version of 4.72 or later is preferred. If you need to install use [Latest .NET framework version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/)

- Below are the comparison operators in powershell

- `-eq`	Equal
- `-ne`	Not Equal
- `-gt`	Greater than
- `-ge`	Greater than or equal to
- `-lt`	Less than
- `-le`	Less than or equal to
- `-like`	Checks if part of string matches (Wildcard comparison)
- `-notlike`	Checks if part of a string doesnâ€™t matches (Wildcard comparison)
- `-match`	RegEx comparison
- `-notmatch`	RegEx comparison
- `-contains`	Containment Operator
- `-notcontains`	Non-Containment Operator
- `-In`	In Operator
- `-notIn`	Non In Operator
- `-Replace`	Replaces a string pattern

## Azure Storage Accounts

- 4 basic types of features: Blob (sharing videos, images and objects), table (storing data), queue (for sending and receiving messages), file(creating file shares)

- Select storage accounts from dashboard and create a new storage account
    - **Basics tab**
    - Assign a resource group
    - Assign a new storage account name - ***This name must be unique and will be part of the URL linking to specific objects inside the container***
    - Select region
    - You can choose between standard or premium performance option. 
                    - The *standard is a general purpose account* (blob, table, queue,file sharing)
                    - Premium is more specific for each of the individual subtypes and has low latency - better suited if you want high performing VM hard disks
    - Choose redundancy- It relates to availability, for extra availability you have more options, but the basic option is (locally redundant storage)
    - **Advanced tab**
    - You can keep the default settings
    - **Networking**
    - Keep the default setting
    - **Data Protection**
    - Keep the soft delete blob checked - A deleted object will remain in place for 7 days untill when it can be recovered
    - **Tags**
    - No changes
    - **Review+Create**
- Once a storage account is created, you can access it under resources and locating it by its name and it will have options of Containers, file shares, tables and queues - each consistent with the 4 basic types of features

**Services inside the storage account**

 - **Blob Service** : This service gives the ability to upload objects- you can access this service by ***clicking the containers inside the storage account***
    - Create a container (typicaly this is how its done for a blob service)
    - Assign a name such as 'data' and select public level access as private(no anonymous access)- the latter is an additional security feature
    - Once you click a container named 'data', then you can upload an object to it such as a file which can be an image file or a text based file
    - You can also modify the file by clicking edit while inside the container
    - The text files can also be viewed in various formats such as javascript etc
    - A unique URL will be available for each of the objects uploaded inside the container
    - If you type in this URL into the browser, you will be able to access this object if the ***Public Access level for the 'data' container is NOT set to private***
    - The access level can be changed by clicking on the container and then clicking "change access" level - selecting Blob(anomymous read access for blobs only) will allow public read only access. This will be applied to blob only, while an alternative option can also be selected for changing access level to container level as well
    - You can create a folder inside the container by selecting the advanced option when uploading the file. Under "upload to folder" you can type in the folder name
    - An example: A company can have an application that uploads videos, those videos can then be uploaded onto a container using the blob service. Each video will have its unique URL. The app can be linked to the storage account. This allows complete separation between the storage account and the application

 - **File Share Service** This is when you want to share a file across multiple users or virtual machines- It gives you the ability to map a drive onto a container- this is not ideal with a blob service.  The difference with blob is that the file there is stored as an object and has a unique URL and the file cannot be maped across multipe users and VMs. You can access the file share service by ***clicking the file share inside the storage account**
    - Create a new file share inside the storage account
    - Assign a name such as 'data' and Set a quota- size limit, can select 1 Gib
    - Then you can open this file share named 'data' as it shows in the storage account
    - You can then create a directory inside this fileshare
    - You can also upload a file into fileshare or inside the directory you have created
    - When you upload a file, a unique file URL will also be created - but the link will not work for public access- This URL is a link to the fileshare which will only work after successful mapping
    - Instead you can connect to the fileshare. This can be done by selecting your OS e-g Windows and then copy the code for connection. The code contains a password. Then you can 1) Either use powershell and copy this code 2) Use windows mapping feature ('map a network drive' in windows folder) and manually paste the password. This will create a new drive in my computer
    - File shares usually occur on port 445

- **Table Service** 
    - 2 Types: SQL-Schema, or No SQL-No Schema
    - Data is usually stored in partitions and entities are then identified uniquely inside the partitions for quick retrival
    - Partition key, used to define the partition to store entities
    - Row key, uniquely identifies an entity in a partition
    - The benifit of partition is the quick retrieval of data- the data is stored in partitions rather than a whole in millions
    - Click tables in the storage account
    - Create table, assign name "customer"
    - When you click the table, you will have to assign a **partiion key** and a **row key** - This is essentially a key value pair, You can also add additional properties
    - **Azure Storage account** Links up your azure account and fetches the storage accounts to your local machine which you can then modify locally on your computer

- **Methods to Access Azure Storage Accounts** you can access blobs by **making the privacy settings public**, you can use **Azure storage explorer**, you can also connect Azure storage explorer using **Access Keys**, **Shared Access Signatures** and **Azure Active Directories**
    - **Using Access Keys**: You can Access the storage account by using the access keys. When inside Azure, click on access keys and then copy the access key one. Then you can open Azure storage explorer, click the storage account, then select account name and key, paste the key and the name-keep the display name the same as the account name
    - **Using Shared Access Signatures (SAS): Blob Level**
    - **Using shared Access signatures- Account Level**
    - **Using Stored Access Policy** to modify shared access account signatures, especially in the event of hacking/unauthorized access - you can thus modify the access level (read, write, delete or remove all of them)
    - **Using Active Directory** - Active directory allows you to create a user then then give access to a particular storage account

    
- **Redundancy/ Availability Zones** Azure typically creates 3 copies of the data- these can be located at multiple data centers in the same or different availability zone in a region or in different regions to ensure that if there is an equipment malfunction or power failure in one area the data is still available

- **Access Tiers** 
    - Hot (used when data is updated/accessed frequently) cold (data accessed/updated infrequently, needs to be stored for at least 30 days) and Archive (slower, least costly, data needs to be stored for atleast 180 days). At the storage account level you can only select between hot or cool, archive is not available. The Archive option is only available at the individual blob level
    - The read costs of Archive are highest ($5, per 10,000^3 reads), then cool ($0.01) and hot ($0.004). So it would cost a lot to archive data that is to be read frequently
    - **Early Deletion Fee** : If you change tiers before the minimum time e-g if you change from cool to hot after 10 days- You will still be charged for 30 days- this is early deletion fee
    - The access tier for a particular storage account can be changed under configuration
    - Beyond the storage level. There is also an option of changing the tier at the level of blob item e-g sample.text inside the container - Note that this individual item inside the storage account can be archived, but not the storage account itself
    - The limitation of Archive tier is that you cannot directly access the object itself- You first have to rehydrate it before you can access it. - Rehydration is changing the object from archive to hot or cool - this can take up to 15 hours, but there is an option of "high priority" that can complete rehydration in under 1 hr if < 1GB
    - In the archived state the blob cannot be edited, you will have to rehydrate it first
    - Only the Blob service allows you to archive data

- **Life cycle Management Rules**: 
    - You can add a rule to a storage account. The rule facilitates automation. It wil be very demanding to manually change access tier for every blob item from cool to archive or hot to cool. For example you can set a rule that if a base blob has not been modified for the past 30 days you can change its tier from hot to cool automatically
    - Likewise you can also create a rule to move a Blob from cool to archive after 180 days
    - The rules can also be disabled and deleted

- **Migrating Storage account from locally redundant storage(LRS) to Zone redundant Storage (ZRS) - Also called Change Replication**
    - options: **Manual** (You create a new storage account in ZRS and copy data from LRS - This will lead to a small downtime) or **live migration** (You request that to Microsoft, there is no downtime for a live migration)
    - You can change the migration settings for a storage account by clicking the configuration of storage account and then modifying "replication"
    - Note that the acccess tier cannot be "Archive" for a blob in the storage account when you are updating the replication
    - Live replication can only be performed with LRS or GRS replication

## Azure Virtual Machine Service

- The general concept is that you deploy virtual machines into a virtual network - The network has an interface with a private and public IP and is protected by firewall in the form of a network security group
- The service level agreements for VM. Single VM=99.9%, Availability Set VM=99.95%, Availability Zone in the same Azure region VM=99.99%

- **Creating Virtual Machines**
    - **Bsics tab** 
        - select subscription - note that every resource must have a subscription and a resource group
        - Name the machine, select availabilty zoon where the latency is likely to be the least
        - Availability options - no redundancy required
        - Select the OS image- Win/Linux etc
        - With size you can specify the Ram
        - You can assign Username and password
        - You can specify inbound port rules - which allows RDP to the virtual machine using a remote computer - This is important, you can also check HTTP(`80`), HTTPS(`443`), SSH(`22`) and RDP(`3389`) - what this does is add a new security rule to the network


    - **Disk tab**
        - Assign disk type- SSD
    - **Networking Tab**
        - Assign a virtual network (A virtual machine has to be a part of a virtual network) if created from before or create new - It will also automatically create a new one if one does not exist already and a public IP as well as a subnet. 
        - A public IP allows the machine to be connected to over the internet
        - Select a NSG (Network security group)
        - Allow selected ports for the public inbound ports
    - Leave **Management, Advanced and Tags tabs** tabs as is - you can select turn of boot diagnostics unser management (Boot diagnostic option is a debugging feature that help diagnose boot faliures of VM)
    - Once you hit review and create the virtual machine is created and you will know how much you will be charged per hr. 
    - Once a machine has been created, you can look at its information (status-running or not, subscription, OS etc) and then the top row of tabs give you options to connect, restart, stop, delete etc options
    - Note that when you created a virtual machine, a number of things associated with it were automatically created: **Virtual network, Network Security group, Network interface, disk and public IP** - these can be looked at but going to 'all resources' and then filtering for the resoure group. Network interface is like having a network card - All data and traffic passes from this card
    - Note that a public IP is important because thats the typical way to connect to the virtual machine from an internet

- Note that you can also change the public ip address of the virtual machine from dynamic to static by selecting configuration under settings of the virtual machine

- **Connecting to a Virtual Machine**
    - There are 3 options: 1) **RDP**- uaually for windows VM, 2) **SSH** - Usually for Linux machines and 3) **Bastion** (Another way to connect- does not require agent, client or other software)

    - With the RDP option, you simply have to specify the IP address and then specify the connectivity option as RDP. It will download a file which you can then run and it will open a portal to enter credentials

- **Installing a webserver on a VM e-g Installing Internet Information Services which is a server based application**
    - Once you RDP into a virtual machine you can open Server Manager Dashboard
    - Click add roles and features
    - Select role-based or feature-based installation
    - Next leave default settings and when you reach "server roles" check Web Server (IIS) - click add features
    - Then next all the way to install. This is a simple webserver installation
    - What this does is allows the virtual machine to listen incoming connections on its port `80` 
    - Now if you run the explorer and type `http://localhost/` the Internet infromation services page will run

- **Accessing the VM from regular internet**
    - You can access the virtual machine on the internet by typing its public Ip address in the browser- you can get that from the information page of the virtual machine in Azure Portal
    - Then you can change the settings of the VM in the NSG by clicking **Add inbound port rule** to select **TCP** portal and **enabling connections to port 80**. Any other port selection wont work, because the internet information services enables the VM to listen for connections at port 80 and the VM firewall must also likewise allow that, if anyother port is allowed at VM NSG then the internet infromation webservices will still see that port 80 is closed and the outside traffic wont be able to access it as this service is only available at port 80 and per NSG port 80 would be closed
    - This rule is telling the firewall to please allow connectivity to port 80 on the VM

- **Managing VM States** - Generally there are two states Running or Stopped. Then there is also a 'stop' tab on the details page - this is different from the stopped status- it is stopped(deallocated) - When this status is in place there are no computing charges and publicIP Maybe lost-see below
    - The VM has **OS or Managed disk** - this disk has high availability and is managed by Azure
    - Another disk is **Temporary disk** - this disk has low availability
    - Note that **Restarting or Shutting down** from inside the VM does not erase data in the temporary disk, this also retains the public IP address of the VM. If you shut down the VM status changes to "stopped" from running. Even if it says stopped, it does not mean that there would be no charge- infact there will be a small computing charge
    - Alternatively, if you hit the "Stop" button from the VM details page, it will erase all data in the temporary disk and will also deallocate the IP address unless you check "Do you want to reserve the Public IP address?"

- `Circle back to setting up a linux virtual machine`

- When **Deleting** a virtual machine you avoid doing it from the virtual machine infomation page, but rather do it from all resources- that way you can also get rid of all the resources associated with that particular VM such as NSG, Vetwork interface, IP, disk etc

- **Virtual Machine Disks** 
    - Managed or Unmanaged disk - prefer managed disks beause they have near 100% availability and they are managed by Azure
    - Unmanaged disks will require a storage account with premium settings general purpose 1 or 2
    - Information about disks can be seen at [the microsoft disk link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types)
    - You can attach a new disk for storing application data by going to the VM, selecting disks and then adding a disk
    - You can add name, select storage type (ultra and premium are expensive), size
    - Then log onto the virtual machine and inside the Server Manager, select File and Storage Services->Server->disks, you will now see the new disk you that you attached to the VM from the portal. Then right click it and initialize it.
    - Once initialized, again right click and select new volume, slect a drive letter and create. 
    
- **Adding a Virtual Network Interface/Secondary Network interface to and existing Virtual Network**
    - You can have a situation where you have two subnets of which one is public and the other is completely private
    - The rationale for adding another network interface would be to have the "public" subnet privately communicate with the second subnet
    - You can first create a virtual machine and while you create it create 2 subnets wiht the network
    - Then Stop the VM from running before adding another network interface card - The VM must be in a stopped(deallocated) state before it can be added to the VM
    - Then in the VM resource select networking and click `Attach network interface`
        - Give a name to this new network interface 'secondary', select subnetB (the second private network). Then hit create
        - Note that for communication between 2 network interfaces there should be correct software and routing

- **Updating a VM Size**
    - Select the VM and then select size
    - When you change the size of the VM, the VM will be restarted
    - Sizing availability may be variable- check with your subscription and the quotas to see whats available

- **Creating an image from an existing Virtual Machine**
    - Note that once a virtual machine is imaged, the original can no longer be used - so it is a destructive process
    - First connect to the VM and inside the Vm navigate to Windows drive->Windows->System32->Sysprep
    - The Sysprep tool will create the image rendering the original non-usable
    - Then you stop the VM `Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName azuredemo -Name demovm -Force` from azure cloud shell. This will deallocate the Vm
    - Once the VM has been deallocated, you can go to the azure portal and select **capture** from the VM tab to create an image
    - Once the image has been created, you can create new VMs using that image. It will have all the default configurations- thats the benifit

- **Availability Set**
    - Assiginig availability set to VMs ensures that the VMs are distributed across multiple fault domain
    - Spreading a large application over multiple virtual machines increases efficiency
    - A virtual machine is typically hosted on rack on a physical Azure data center and each rack has its own power and network. If there is an issue with the power or network of a rack then the virtual machines as well as the apps can go down
    - When you add an availability set to a VM, it gets added to a **fault domain** (Deals with faults in hardware) as well as an **Update domain** (Deales with software)
    - Each fault domain is an independent server in a data center and has its own independent powersupply and network
    - The update domains handle updating the server - typically when an availability set is assigned it ensures that the distribution of VMs is such that not all VMs are out during maitainance with updates or power or networking issues - this ensures availability
    - Manged disks should be used instead of unmanaged disks when an availability set is assigned
    - Most regions have a maximum of 2 or 3 fault domains
    - If your application has a web tier (where User interacts with the app) and an application tier - the part of the app where the servers are hosted. Each of the two tiers should have separate availability sets - They should not be combined together

- **Creating an Availability Set**
    - **Basic Tab**
        - create a new availability set from a dashboard
        - Select subscription, resource group, region
        - Select the number of update and fault domains 2:2 is ok. The fault domains cannot be more than 3 usually, the update domains can by up to 20
        - Use Managed disk
    - **Advanced Tab**
            - You can select a proximity placement group which ensures that the VMs are closer together
    - Then when you create a virtual machine, you can assign an availability set to it. There is also an option of creating a new availability set at the time of creatig a new virtual machine
    - Scenario: if a company wants to transfer to cloud and you want to ensure that at least 4 VMs are running during the planned maintainance period- then the total number of VMs you should design is 5

- **Virtual Machine Scale Set**
    - It is an automation tool based on CPU load. A better strategy to deal with overload is to distribute the request load over multiple VMs rather than increasing power of a single VM
    - What a scale set does is that for instance if a CPU work load increases say to 75% it will add an additional VM to the set automatically, in order to distribute the workload.
    - Likewise the scale set also has the ability to decrease the number of virtual machines in the set if the CPU usage drops to say 25% - you only pay for what you use so it is economical
    - **Using a virtual machine scale set**
        - Add a resource and select `virtual machine scaleset`
            - **Basics tab**
                - Select resoure group, assign name, select region as well as VM specifications (image, spot instance-no, disk size, authentication type as user/pw). You can leave the availability zone to none 
            - **Disks tab**
                - Leave as is/Premium SSD
            - **Networking tab**
                - VN configuration will automatically create a new newtwork
                - Edit network interface: Allow selected ports for example port 22 for SSH for Linux VM
                - Enable public IP address
            - **Scaling tab**
                - Initial instance you can select as 1
                - You can select the scaling policy to be custom: selecting the min or max VMs to be 1-3
                - Then you can select the **scale out** option set at 75% CPU usage for 10 min - increase VM by 1
                - Then likewise you can select the **scale in** option set at 25% to decrease VM by 1
            - **Management tab**
                - Leave boot diagnostics off
                - Rest as is
            - **Health, Advanced and Tags tabs**
                - Leave as is
        - Once this is done you can go to the scale set recource and look at inststances - you will see 1 Vm running
        - Then access the virtual machine - get the public IP when you copy it, it will let you run the linux VM after you paste the Ip address. Then 
        - Upon logging into a linux machine you can update packages: `sudo apt-get update`
        - Then you can test the scale set in action by installing a package called  **stress**: `sudo apt-get install -y stress`
        - Then you can run the stress app on the linux VM by running `sudo stress --cpu 90`
        - This after it lasts for 10 min, it will atutomatically scale out VMs from 1 to 3 as you selected
        - During the scale out process, when a new VM is automatically added, it does not automatically also install the web app - It will have to be done manually by using custom script extensions which are basically commands that install the application
        - Another option is to create a custom VM image with a pre-installed applcation and use the additional VMs during the scale out process which will then have pre-installed application in them
        - You should also use Azure load balancer to uniformly distribute the user load across the new VMs. The user traffic will go to a load balancer and it will then distribute it across the VMs

     - **Availability Zones inside the Region**
        - Availability zone guards at the level of individual data center failure, while an availability set is still inside a data center but has different fault and update domains to improve availability
        - An Availability zone is a collection of data centers (Multiple data centers per zone)
        - There are multiple availability zones in one region
        - There is no additional cost for creating an availability set and there is no additional cost for creating an availability zone
        - However, there can be additional brandwith costs with regards to the communication between two VMs in different zone but there are no costs associated with commnication between two VMs within the same availability set
        - So Creating Availability set is less costly than creating an availability zone indirectly due to the brand width
        - Note that you choose for the availability set vs availability zone under the `availability options` When creating a VM
        - Note that if you have an application that will be distributed over multiple VMs then its good to have the VMs over an availability zone
        - You can also select for availability zone while creating a virtual machine scale set - But be sure to have the starting instances for VMs to be 3 regardless of scaling options and then check for Zone 1,2,3 under the availability zone. In the scaling leave the initial instance count as 3. 

    - **Using Azure dedicated host**
        - Large companies can also have their own dedicated host -that way then can control the timeframe of when the maintainance events can take place on a physical host
        - On a dedicated host, only the company's VMs will be place, no other VMs
            - You can select **Create a dedicated host** from resources to create a dedicated host
                - **Basics tab**
                    - Add name and a host group name
                    - Select the number of availability zones (1) and fault domain count (2)
                    - The subscription will dictate whether you can have a dedicatd host - typically it requires 96 vCPUs



## Azure Virtual Networks

- A virtual network should have a broad Address space, typically: `10.1.0.0/16`
- Within a virtual network you can have two or more subnets - each subnet with its own address space (10.1.1.0/24 each)
- Network interface - All data packets pass from a network interface to or from a VM - a network interface has a public and a private IP address
- The private IPs are usually for communication between to subnets or between two Vnets via peering
- There are 2 SKUs (Stock Keeping Unit) Basic (Uses dynamic IP addresses, no availability zone available)  and standard (uses static IP addresses, availability zone available)

- **Creating a Virtual Network**
    - **Basics tab**
        - Select a subscription, resource group and name of virtual network
    - **IP Address**
        - Assigining the IP address name `10.0.0.0/16`
        - Note that a default subnet will be created for `10.0.0.0/24 `- You can change its name from default
    - **Security**
        - Leave as is
    - **Tags**
        - Leave as is

- **Adding a new subnet**
    - When you select the Vnet that you just created, under setting you can select subnets and this will display the current subnets in the network
    - Then you can add a new subnet by clicking the + subnet tab
    - The wizard will automatically select an IP range that is different from the previous subnet - in this case `10.0.1.0/24`
    - You can assign a network security group or leave the default settings for now
    - Now you will have 2 subnets
    - You can change the range of the subnet CIDR block until no VM has been created in the subnet- This is important, because once a VM is created, an IP address will be assigned from the subnet range and then you cannot change the subnet range in the virtual network for that particular subnet in question
    - You can also modify the network mask (the broader CIDR of 10.0.0.0/16) by selecting address space under settings of the virtual network and/or add a new mask such as `20.0.0.0/16`
    - The ip address ranges of the subnets must be a subset of the broader netmask

- Note that you can always change the IP address of the VM from dynamic to static
- You can also disable the public IP address of a network interface card by going to the network interface, select IP configurations, selecting ip condfig and then selecting disable under public IP

## Network Security Groups

- It is like a firewall for a traffic that comes in and out of the network
- It can be assigned to a network interface card or an entire subnet. If it is tied to a subnet - it will affect all VMs in it
- There are **Inbound** and **Outbound** security rules that control traffic comming in and out of the network respectively

- **Elements of a network Security Group**
    - Priority about which rule should run first - The lower the number the higher the priority (The minimum priority nuber is 100) - Note that if the request matches the priority rule, no further rules will be evaluated
    - Port e-g `80`
    - Protocol - RCP or UDP
    - Source and Destination (e-g source can be a public computer's ip and the destination can be the company's network)

    `circle back to find when a new VM is created and why it cannot be connected until RDP is enabled and what does RDP do`


- For a virtual network, two layers of network security / firewalls can be applied. The first NSG maybe applied at the level of the virtual network - this is the first pass. The second one is at the level of of subnet. The traffic must be allowed at the first NSG at the network level before it can reach the second network at the subnet level. Likwise request maybe allowed at the VNet level NSG but deined by the rules set at the subnet level  

- You can view the network security access rules by logging into the VM via RDP and then from the dashboard clicking Add roles and features
- Then select webserver roles

**Levels of 


- **Creating a Network Security Rule**
    - Create a Virtual machine as usual, while creating it create a virtual network under networking -select its subnet
    - While creating the VM select Network security group as basic and allow selected ports - This is the basic version
    - You can select the advanced option to create your own security rule

- After creating a VM when you look at the network interface, under the networking tab you will see Inbound port rules. Note that there are a set of default rules (65000,65001,65500) that cannot be changed, then there are a set of custom rules that you create (Such as permitting RDP access on port 3389) which can be modified

- You can also check how these rules are in effect from inside the VM - select Local Server in the Serve Manager dashboard and then click on enhanced security configuration

- **Creating security rules in NSG**

- You can type `(Invoke-WebRequest ifconfig.me/ip).content.Trim()` in powershell to obtain the public IP address of your computer
- Then you can go to the network interface | Networking again and modify the inbound RDP rule and under the `source` paste your computer IP - this will now only allow this particular IP to connect to the VM
- Note that this rule is related to RDP not connection to the internet - it controls which IP is allowed to RDP to a VM (i-e running the RDP file and then logging into the VM) - It is a different port- port `3389` - this rule is not letting you connet to the VM over the internet

    - **Creating a security rule to access VM from internet**
        - In order to do that port 80 must be open on the VM - which hosts Http
        - In contrast the opening port at the remote internet workstation can be any port (*), as when the connection is established with the port 80 on the VM a port on the connecting workstation is usually randomly assigned
        - So, go to VM, select the networking tab and then select the network interface, from there select the inbound port rules
            - **Inbound rule**
                - You can add a service tag as internet
                - For source port ranges type `*`
                - For destination select any
                - For Service select HTTP
                - This will automatically select the destination port ranges to be 80 and the protocol to be TCP
                - Action: Allow
                - Name: port_80
    
- **Creating a NSG group separately and then associating it with a virtual network**
    - Go to all resources and search for a network security group 
    - Create a network security group with basic information - Subscription, resource group, name, region
    - Note that the default creation of this NSG will not allow any traffic on port 80 - for that to happen, an inbound exception rule must be created - the default setting for an NSG is deny all traffic
    - Then go to that NSG resource that you just created and then under settings select subnets
    - Click `+ Associate` tab in the subnet
    - This will allow you to select a pre-existing virtual network from a list, along with the subnet you are trying to apply the NSG to
    - You can also disassociate a particular NSG from a network by going to the NSG and selecting subets under settings


    `circle back at installing the MySQL server and using application security groups`

- **Using a Jump-Box Server to connect with virtual machines**

- The goal is to create a network that has a subnet which contains a VM for a webserver. Then create another Jump-Box server that will be used to configure the webserver VM

    - **Create a Virtual Network**
        - **Basics tab**
            - add information about the network - name, subscription, etc
        - **IP Addresses**
            - select the net mask 10.0.0.0/16
            - This will also automatically add a subnet to your virtual network
        - **Security and other tabs**
            - Leave as is

    - **Create a virtual machine inside the virtual network for a Webserver**
        - To create a virtual machine you can select to create a virtual machine from resources independently and then during configuration select the virtual network and the subnet of which you want this virtual machine to be a part of
        - Allow RDP inbound port as you are going to connect the jump-box to the virtual network
        - It should not have a public IP
        - This can be done under the networking tab while creating the VM

    - **Add another subnet to the virtual network for the Jump-Box VM**
        - Select the virtual network that you previously created from resources
        - Then under setting, select subnet
        - Click `+ subnet` to add another subet to the network - You can name this as `Jump-box-subnet` 
        
    
    - **Create a virtual machine inside the Jump-box-Subnet for a Jump-Box-Server**
        - Create a new virtual machine like before and during configuration select the Jump-box-subnet
        - You will allow the inbound RDP port because at least you will be publically connecting to this VM from you workstation
        - Thus it should also have a public IP - This can be done under the networking tab 
        - Also important to the Jump-Box-Server Vm and select networking under settings, then select the RDP rule, under that rule specity the source as Ip address and then paste you workstation IP address - This will limit the accessibility of the Jumb-box to only your workstation Ip address and is more secure
        - Also note the PRIVATE IP address of the Jump-box server - This is the only IP address the Webserver VM should be allowed to accept
        - `Next go to the Webserver VM, check that there is no public IP. Select Networking under settings. Go to the inbound rule for RDP and under source select IP address and then paste the private ip address of the Jump-Box-Server VM e-g 10.0.1.4/32` Note that here by adding /32 you are specifying that there is only one IP address
    
- With these steps you will not have a virtual network and 2 subnets one containing a webserver VM and the other containing the Jump-box-Server VM
- Once you have logged into the Jump-box-Server by RDP in azure, then click on the RDP connection from start and paste the private ip address of the webserver VM

## Azure Bastion Service as an Alternative to Traditional Jump-Box

    
    
- `Circle back and review the service endpoints in association with virtual network, storage accounts and storage explorer`


## Using a Custom Route in a Virtual Network as an extra security feature

- **Creating a Custom Route Table**
    - Go to all recources and search for route table
    - Click create route table
    - create a Route by clicking `+ Route`
        - Add route name, Address prefix (this is the netmask of the entire Vnet-this is because we want to cover all IP addresses on which this route should be applicable for)
        - Under the **Next hop type** select virtual appliance
        - Under the **Next hop address** past the PRIVATE IP address of the 'inspecting VM or the intermediary VM' b/w the webserver and the databse server VMs
    - Once you have created the route, next you associate the route with the subnets (Webserver subnet, database subnet)
    - You can associate by selecting the custom route you just created and then under setting select subnets and then click `+ Associate` tab
        - Select the virtual network and the subnet (The one containing the webserver VM) - Note that this step will fw the traffic from the webserver to the inspecting VM subnet- you are not done yet. You now have to configure routing from the inspecting VM to the database VM
        - Go to the inspecting VM, under settings select networking and then network interface
        - Once in the network interface, under settings select IP configurations and then **_Enable_** `IP forwarding`
    - Once the Custom routing is configured on Azure, in the inspecting VM, you have to install a software
        - After RDP into the inspecting VM, select roles and features, then select server roles, select remote access, then under role services select routing- leave the rest of the settings as default and then install
        - After installing the software for remote access, you have to configure the remote access so select configure remote access from the flags
        - Select the inspectig VM and right click to select `configure and enable routing and remote access`
            - select custom configuration
            - select LAN routing


## Virtual network peering

- Connecting 2 networks. One VM from one network, communicating with one VM from another network
- In Azure, when two Vnets communicate via linked VMs, the traffic is on the Azure network only - it does not happen on the internet
- Networks can be connected across regions, and across different subscriptions
- It is important that the Virtual Network IP addresses do not overlap - otherwise you can not establish peering
- VNets both in the classic deployment models cannot be connected

    - **Step 1: Create a new virtual machine**
        - Fill in the basics as usual, allow RDP
        - Leave disks as is
        - Under networking, create a new network (16 bit CDIR)
        - Add a subnet /24
        - leave rest of the settings as is
    - **Step 2: Create another new virtual machine with another VNet**
        - Same as above, different names

    - Then RDP into first - go to roles and features
        - Select server selection
        - Install Web Server IIS
        - Note that if you type in the public IP of this VM in the browser from your workstation (outside VMs), it wont show the internet services page, because you have not set up any inbound rule to listn on port 80

    - Then RDP into the second VM
        - Once you RDP into the machine - go onto the local server
        - Turn off Enhanced Security Configuration
        - Now if you paste the private ip address of the first VM into the browser, you will not be able to see the internet services because no peer to peer connection is established yet. If peer to peer connection was established then 

    - **Step 3: Establishing the Peering Connection b/w the two Virtual networks**
        - Select one of the virtual networks and under settings select **peerings** to add a new Virtual network peering connection
        - give it a name (This is the name of connection from V1->V2)
        - It will be a two way connection VM1 to VM2 and VM2 to VM1
        - Select allow traffic
        - Select virtual gateway or route Server as none
        - Give the name of the second peering connection (V2->V1)
        - Then choose the second VNet's name
        - This establishes the second connection

- Note that after the peering is established and then when you log into VM2 and type in the private IP address of VM1, you should be able to see the internet information services page

- **Establishing a point to site VPN connection**
- The goal of a point to site VPN connection is to allow an on premise machine to connet with the remote azure network
    - Create a Target virtual network - Note that the VM in this network should only have a private ip address
    - Create a gateway subnet inside the virtual network (the gatway between the virtual network and the premisis workstations)
    - Create a **virtual network gateway** separately and then attach it to the virtual network - Note that the virtual network gateway is essential to establish a point to site connection and can only be used if there is a pre-existing gateway subnet - Takes 45 minutes to create a virtual network gateway. The virtual network gateway controls the routing from the user workstations on premesis to the Azure remote company network by creating virtual machines inside the gateway subnet of the Vnet which facilitates this routing
    - The virtual network gateway has a **public ip** address. This ip address is accessible to the user network via the internet. Once the user network VM connects with the virtual network gateway via the gateway's public ip address. 

- For the outside computers to connect to this network your company must have its own signed certificates (called root certificate) or a certificate provider. Only the certificates will allow you to connect to the network
- For a secure connection over the internet, the machine on premisis should only be allowed to connect to a private IP address of the VM in the subnet
- Once the**Root certificate** is issued it can generate a user certificate with a private key (premesis) and export a network certificate with a public key (Vnet gateway), the root certificate must be exported with a **public key** - to connect with **Virtual Network Gateway**, simultaneously the certificate's **private key** is with the user workstation on premesis
- Then a VPN client can be downloaded and installed from Azure to the user workstation, which will make a point to site connection by doing these certificate activities behind the scenes
- If there are multiple user workstations, they will all share the same user certificate with a private key
- The **Virtual network gateway** also has a public ip address 

- Now You can create 2 networks 1) Azure Company Remote Network -This will have subnet gatewaay and Vnet gateway, 2) User workstation on premesis Network 
     - **Step 1: Creating the Azure Company remote network**
        - Start with creating a **Virtual Machine** and while creating it also create a network and in that network create a subnet
            - This can be done finding virtual machine from resources and create a new VM
            - create a new resource group
            - select location, no infrastructre, select size, create administrator account
            - Keep the default settings for disks, advanced, tags
            - Under Networking tab be sure to select **No public IP**
            - **Create a new network** using the networking tab
                - Assign name and address range such as `10.1.0.0/16` (Bigger range here as the VM and subnet will be contained inside it)
                - Withing the same form create a subnetA with address range `10.1.0.0/24` - The SubnetA will contain the 
                - Also select no public ip address for subnetA
                - Leave the rest as default
        - Now that the **VM** is created. It has no public address so you cannot connect to it from you laptop
        - With private ip address, you can use **Custom Scripts Extensions** to install **Internet Information Services**
            - You can do this by selecting **extensions** from the left pannel while the particular VM is selected and click add
            - Select custom script extension and click create
            - Click Add a script file - You will have to create a storage account - create a new storage account as prompted
                - Create a storage account, give name, select general purpose V2, standard performance
                - Then create a container within the storage account
                - Then go into the container and upload the powershell script which contains the script to install internet information services (see the code below)
                - Then select the file click ok for it to run

**Powershell extension script for installing internet information services on a VM with a private ip address only**
```
import-module servermanager
add-windowsfeature web-server -includeallsubfeature
add-windowsfeature Web-Asp-Net45
add-windowsfeature NET-Framework-Features 
```

 - **Step 2: Create Local premesis network**
    - Start with creating a VM
        - Select region, no infrastructure redundancy, standard D2, V2 memory, select windows machine, select username and pw
        - check multi-tenant rights for wondows 10, you need to have abaser version of a license as well s the enterprise version license. Most big corporations have a contract with microsoft where they have enterprise licenses - This is an imp point
        - Create a new virtual network
        - Keep the public ip address

- Once the VM and the second user Vnet are created, you can RDP to it with the user details
- Now we have 2 networks in place 

- **Step 3: Creating a gateway subnet setup in Azure network and virtual netwok gateway**
    - **Gateway subnet**
        - You can select the VM, then click the network from the main page, select subnets under settings in the left pannel of the network
        - Under the subnets you will see and option to create a **Gateway subnet**
        - Slect Ip range: 10.1.1.0/24, rest leave as is
    - **Virtual Network gateway**
        - Once the gateway subnet is created, you can search in the general dashboard for **Virtual Network Gateway**
        - Next go to the main dashboard and search for **Virtual Network Gateway**
            - Give it a name
            - Gatway tpe: VPN
            - VPN type: Route based
            - SKU: Basic - select other options based on the cost, the price is influnced by the amound of **brandwidth** (basic has 100MPs- can go up in Gbps)
            - Virtual network: Select the Azure Company network - Note that if the gateway subnet is not created in the network, Azure would not allow you to select the network
            - **Public Ip address:** Create new, assign a name and leave rest of the settings as is
        - The process takes about 30-45 min as creating the Virtual Network Gateway includes launching VMs for routing in the gateway subnet of the Azure Company Network
        - Once the Virtual Network Gateway is created you can then select the gateway and from the settings pannel select **point to site configuration**
        - For establishing point to site configuration, the first thing is to generate **Certificates**
- **Step 4: Generating Certificates**
            - First you generate a **Root certificate** and then from the root certificate you can generate a **client certificate**
                - The public key of the root certificate must be uploaded in the Virtual network gateway - This will allow the virtual network gateway to trust the traffic with this certificate
                - Then generate a client certificate from the root certificate, the client certificate then must be installed on the individual user workstations on premesis
                - Large organizations usually have a certificate authority alternatively on a lower scale you can generate a self signed certificate
                - You can do this by RDP into the user workstation VM and then using power shell commands to first generate a root certificate and then generating a client certificate with another command after the root certificate is generated. See below
                - Then in windows search, go to manage user certificates, go to personal folder, you will be able to see the generation of the root and the client certificate

    - **Exporting the root certificate**: Then click the root certificate and right click > all tasks > Export
                    - Follow the steps, you can choose not to export the private key, choose base-64 encoded, then save the file on the desktop
                    - Then locate the exported certificate on the desktop and then right click to open with notepad to see the contents of the certificate
    - **Point to site congifuration of the Virtual Network Gateway**
                - Address pool: This should specify the range of ip addresses of the client e-g `172.16.0.0/24`
                - Root certificates: `Name`-rootcertificate, `public certificate data`- copy the contents of the root certificate in the notepad bw "begin certificate" and "end certificate"
                - Revoked certificates: leave blank
                - Specifying the configurations above will generate a VPN client which will have the root certificate data
                - the next step is to **install the VPN client on the user workstation** that should be allowed to access the Azure company network

                `circle back to the process of installing client/root certificates on user VMs`

**Power shell commands for generating the root certificates**

 // To generate the root certificate
```
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -KeySpec Signature `

-Subject "CN=RootCertificate" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable `

-HashAlgorithm sha256 -KeyLength 2048 `

- **Establishing a site to site connection**
- You can use Site to Site connection for connecting your entire on premesis data center with the Azure company virtual network. This will establish a secure tunnel b/w the local data ceneter and the azure company network
- You should have a router at your local data center which can be a software or a physical device. 
- To simulate a local data center you can create an independent VNet in Azure and install **Routing and Remote Services** on a windows server machine to perform routing tasks

- Note that for both networks created below, use a common resource group

    - **Step 1: Build Azure Company Network Create a Virtual network with Vnet Gateway+Subnet gateway+VM  similar to the Steps 1,3 & 4 from Point to site connection above**
        - This should give you a Virtual network whose Vnet gateway has been setup and the network contains a subnet and a VM. 
        - Install Internet information services
        - Note that in this network only the Vnet gateway has a public ip, the VM in the network only has a private ip address
        - Create a new **virtual network gateway**
            - Choose VPN, route based VPN
            - SKU: VpnGw2, generation2
            - Create a public ip addresss
            - name: sitegateway

    - **Step 2: Build Vnet  to simulate a local datacenter**
        - The goal is to route local traffic from a local datacenter to the Azure company Network on the cloud via a secure tunnel
        - Create a Virtual machine along with its Vnet
            - Search for virtal machine from the main dashboard
            - Create a name, assign the common resource group, select region, availability(no redundancy required), OS image: windows server 2016 datacenter-gen1 size as usual
            - Use administrator credentials
            - Unlike the VMs in the Azure Vnet, the VMs in the local data center must have public Ip addresses, because these will be connecting to the Azure network over the internet via a secure tunnel that will let you connect with the private ip address of the VMs in the Azure Vnet
        - Create a Virtual network while creating the virtual machine
            - name it: local-datacenter, ip range 10.3.0.0/16
            - Create 2 subnets: SubnetA 10.3.0.0/24, subnetB 10.3.1.0/24, note that the ip ranges for the two subnets withing the Vnet must have different ranges
            - Public Ip address is needed
            - RDP
            - Maagement, advanced, tags as is
        - Once the VM with network is created, select the VM and click connect to RDP, this means download and run the RDP file
            - From the server manager dashboard click add roles and features
                - Under server roles check `Remote Access`
                    - Under role services check `routing`, this will automatically check "DirectAccess and VPN". Then install
                - Once the installation of remote access/routing services is complete, click the notification that confirms this and click `open the getting started wizard`
                    - Select `deploy VPN only` - this will open up a routing and remote access configuration window
                        - right click and select: `configure and enable routing and remote access`
                            -select `custom configuration` and then `LAN routing` and `Demand-dial connections` then head to finish and start service
    
    - **Step 3: Building a local network gateway for the local datacenter network**
        - The public ip address of the local data center must be specified in the local network gateway
        - **Creating local network gateway**
            - Go to the general dashboard and search for the local network gateway and click create
            - Give name
            - Paste the PUBLIC IP address of the local data center VM (not of the vnet/subnet)
            - Address space: Vnet ip range of the local data center e-g 10.3.0.0/16 in this case
            - Then select resource group and the location
    - Once the local network gateway is created, you can search for it in the main dashboard under all resources and typing in gateway to shortlist
        - At this point you should be able to see 2 gateways when you type gateway in the search box: 1) the local network gateway for local data center 2) The virtual network gateway for the
    
    - **Step 4: Establishing a site to site VPN collection once the local data center Vnet and the Azure Vnet along with their gateways have been established**
        - Select the Azure Vnet gateway and select point to site cofiguration under settings (to create a site to site the same avenue can be used)
            - Click configure now
            - Note that if you used a gateway of a higher SKU, it will give additional functions and security features - but will be more expensive
        - Go to connections under settings from the left pannel of Azure Vnet | Connections
            - Under **connection type** select `site to site`, and give a name to the connection
            - Select the Virtual network gateway (of Azure Vnet) and the local network gateway (of local datacenter Vnet)
            - You will have to assign a **Shared key (PSK)**. This key is important and must be incorporated with the settings iside the local datacenter VM. In otherwords the key b/w the local data center VM must match with the key in the Vnet gateway connection
        Once the connection is created, go to its main page, you will find some information regarding traffic status I/O

    - **Step 5: Configuring the Routing and Remote Services on local data center VM to route traffic to the Azure Vnet gateway using the Azure Vnet gateway's public IP**
        - Open routing and remote access on the local-datacenter VM
        - select the "network Interfaces" under the VM nme from the left pannel of categories
            - right click and select `new demand-dial interface`
            - give a name - preferable to remind that you are configuring for routing to the Azure Vnet gateway
            - Select `connect using virtual private netowrking`
            - VPN connection type: IKEv2
            - Destination IP: The public IP address of the Azure Vnet gateway
            - Check `Route IP packets on this interface`
            - Next you have to add a destination under Static Routes for Remote networks -click add
            - Destination: The address range of the Azure Vnet (not the Azure Vnet gateway) : type in the ip of the Azure Vnet range excluding the 16/24 portion and then specify the corresponding network mask
            - Allocate metric - its like setting priority/weightage
            - No need to setup dial-out credentials so leave blank >finish
            - Once done, right click the connection by selecting it from the list by its name under Network interfaces
                - right click properties
                    - Go to securities tab
                    - select `use preshared key for authentication`
                        - paste the **preshared key** we created earlier
    
    - Once the configuration is done you can test it by copying the private Ip of the VM in the Azure Vnet and then pasting it in the webrowser after RDP into the local datacenter VM
        - If the internet services page is displayed that means that you are now able to access the Azure Vnet VM from the local data-center VM by using the Azure Vnet Vm's private Ip address

    - **Trouble shooting : checks**
        - make sure that the public Ip address specified under properties of the site to site connection is the public Ip of the Azure Vnet gateway
        - Under the properties again make sure that in the security tab the preshared key is correct
        - Then in the Routing and remote access window, the left pannel > IPv4 >static routes, make sure that the Ip here is the ip address of the Azure Vnet along with correct subnet masking
            - What this is doing is telling the local datacenter VM's network interface card that if an ip address is typed and it falls in the range specified then forward it to the Azure Vnet gateway

    - **If Azure Vnet is peered with another Vnet and letting Local-datacenter Vnet to connect to that additional peering Vnet**
        - Create another Vnet (the 3rd Vnet) - enable port 80 when creating the VM, install internet information services
        - Establish peering with the Azure company Vnet
        - Once created, go to that network 
            - Select peerings from the under the settings > click Add
            - Leave the settings as is, but under the network select the Azure Company Vnet
            - Give peering link names
            - Under "Virtual network gateway or route Server for the 'new link` name
                - select `use remote virtual network's gateway or route server`, note that this must be selected under both link names
                - But under the virtual network gateway or toute server forthe 'new link' name for the 'azure link' name select `use this virtual network's gateway or Route server`
                - See video 104 under infrastructure
            - Once the peering connection is created. You also have to add a new static route in the local-datacenter VM
                - In the routing and remote access window
                    - select static routes from the left pannel
                        - right click and select add a new static route
                            - Destination: Enter the ip and the network mask of the 3rd network

## Azure Backup service
    - Separate resource Azure Recovery services vault- should be in the same region as the azure network
    - subsequent backup is intellegent, only the changes are recovered after the first one
    - Managed by backup policies and based on retention facilities
    - A revovery point is also created every time a backup is created
        - Options for revovery: File revovery, VM recovery, disk revovery
    - Backup service: Application-consistent, filesystem consistent and crash consistent

    - Backup is saved in recovery services vault
    - Backup policy, there is a default policy
    - Enabling backup is not the same as the backup actually happening - it will only 
    you can also backup now manually
    - view all jobs to see progress on backup

- **Azure Recovery Service Agent or MARS (Microscoft Azure Recovery Service) Agent**
    - It is a software that you can install on a VM that gives you more control over how and what to specifically backup. You can specify retention policy
    - MARS agent recovers the agent onto the recovery services vault. 

## Azure Active Directory

- With every account you can create an active directory
- you can create usernames, you can attach users to groups and roles
- You can also create groups- a group is a collection of groups
- You can register a custom domain name in Azure to create users
- Azure Active Directory licensing (there is free, office 365 apps , premium1 premium2) The premium has some extra features likes ability of password self pw reset
- You can try out the Azure AD premium P2 for 30 days, 6-9$ per user per month. You have to specify the user's location before you can assign a license. You purchase the license based on the user assignment
- In Azure acrive directory, you have a default directory and the you can also have a new directory. You may need to create a new directory for each of the individual companies in an organization
- When it comes to subscriptions for active directory, you have have a separate subscription for staging and production environement
- Creating a tenant is the same as creating a directory
- Subscriptions:
    - Staging 
    - Production
- One subscription can only trust one directory. Each department within a company can have its own subscription
- For a given subscription, you can also change the directory. 
- You can go to the dashboard and look at all the subscriptions- When you click a subscription you will be able to see what directory is assigned.
- You can also switch a default directory linked to subscribtion
- You can create a tenant - which is the same as creating a new directory

- **Multi-factor Authentication**
    - MFA registeration
    -SMS code, authenticator app, call are options
    - To set it up select the default directory through the dash board and then go to security and from there select multifactor authentication
    - Then you can select a user from a default directory, status: disabled, enabled, enforced
        - once enforced for a user. The user will have to undergo multi-user registeration
        - The user will be prompted for MFA registeration where ther user will be able to specify what mode of authentication the user prefers
        - When a user logs in for the first time he/she will be prompted to update the password
    - On the local on-premisis network you can define trusted IPs , this will sure that the users will not get requested for MFA
   - **Trusted Devices**
        - There is an option where you can check that the MFA can remember the device, and you can set time limit when to when the device must be authenticated
        - You can also specify the setting where you enlist a particular ip address or a subnet which wont be subject to MFA
-   **Conditional Access policies** you can select this from the left pannel under settings of security in default directory and select conditional access
        - All users, or selected users
        - High sign in risk?
        - Device platform (e-g windows device)
        - Location (on premis location)
        - Block or grant access based on the condition such as MFA
    - **Azure Active Directory identity protection**
        - Uses microsoft built in intelligence to detect identity based risks
            - Catching anonymus ip address
            - Location not typically used by the user- atypical trvel
            - unfamiliar sign in propertis
            - You can specify user risk policy, sign-in risk policy or MFA policy
    - **Access reviews**
        - A user have various assignments. These can include Azure AD role, Azure resources, or a particular user group
        - There needs to be periodic reviews to test that the users have the correct assignments
        - If the user has shifted departments, the access my need to be modified
        - Creating Access review
            - **Identity Governance** from dashboard
                - Access reviews
                    - Create a new access review
                        - you select an admin account where the access review will be delivered
                        - you can specify frequency
                        - you can specify end date
                        - The report can have recommendations based on the activity
                        - You can also stop the access review
    
    - When you create your Azure account, you have a default directory which is also known as a default tenant. you can also create a additional new tenant/directory in an account by clicking 'new tenant'
    - Active directory is essentially a directory of users
    - The subscriptions can be tagged to a particular directiry
    - At a given time one subscription can only be tagged to one directory at a time
    - you can also delete a tenant

- Note that when you make configurations

    **Azure AD Connect Service** Migrating local users to Azure AD directory (Syncronization only works in the direction of on premesis > Azure AD)
        - Azure AD component
            - Password hash synchronization  - transfer password hashes - synconization of hash of the hash
            - Pass through authentication - Authenticated in the on premesis environement then the user can access Azure resources
            - Password writeback - Synconization of password change
        - IdFix- identifies errors in the on premesis environment before syncomization
        Azure AD Global Administrator account
        Enterprise Adminidtrator account

    - You have to install active directory services on the virtual machine. Change the ip address from dynamic to static
    - Once the syncronization is complete, the users are added from the active directory domain
    - Main benifits are that you can avoid user duplicates. The Azure premesis can syncronize with Azure Active directory
    - Note that the flow of syncronization is always from the premesis AD to Azure AD and not from Azure AD to premesis
    - In the virtual machine, you can start Azure AD configuration by searching. 
    - You do not always need to configure for all the users in the active directory. For example, some large enterprize can have users in the testing/staging environment that may not need to be configured. You can uncheck **staging mode** in the case

    - **Pass through authentication**
        - typically is the hash password syncornization
        - There is a VM on premesis that has active directory of users, in pass through the user credentials are first passed through the on premessis active directory and then it connect with the Azure active directory. The benifit is that there can be some extra services/processess such a multi-factor authentication on the local directory which you would prefer to run before syncronization with the Azure active directory
        - The default is usually Password hash syncronization, you can select pass-through synchronization instead

    - **Single Sign on** Avoid the need for password if the user is defined in both the local AD as well as the Azure AD
        - Log onto the VM on the local premisis, then on the local VM search for active directory- directory server- there you will find all the users. So for a particular user, if you double click it make suer that longon hrs are permissible 24/7
        - Select user sign-in and then enable single sign-on
        - It works with password hash synchronization and pass-through authentication
        - Then go to azure portle via the explorer and login using the same user credentials of interest
        - The user is already defined in the local active directory as well as the Azure Ad
        - Then go to Azure AD connect > Change user sign in, login > Enable single sign on and check password hash synchronization >configure
        - Once the configuration is complete, exit. Then go to client VM/local. IE settings, security>local intranet - be sure that there is no check on 'enable protected mode' - A few other settings as well

    - **Password write back**
        - Note that the flow of synchronization is always from the local AD to Azure AD and never from Azure AD to local AD
        - If the password is changed in the Azure AD using the reset from the azure account, it will create a miss match as it wont be able to be updated in the local AD
        - You can fix this by going to the Azure AD connect and then you can go to optional features and enable **password writeback** What this does is directly writes back the password into the AZ local directory when it is reset from the Azure Ad

    - **Domain-UO Filtering**
        - With this you are specifying the domains only for which the local-azure AD synchronization should be performed
            - Customize synchronization options
                - Select sync selected domains and OUs (OU=organization Unit)

    - **Azure AD Connect health Agent**
        - Checks how successful was the synchronization - whether there were errors - you can download it. You can get some graphs
        - AS DS services

    - **Azure AD Scenarios**
        - Corporate data center, microsoft active directory (not the same as Azure AD) - does not have all the features. Policies feature is not available on Azure AD
            - Install azure active directory on an azure VM  and then have a site to site VPN connection
            - Azure AD domain services - Host active directory in Azure network - this active directory is like the microsoft AD
            - Azure AD DS or Self Managed AD DS
            - The user on the active directory side must be a part of Enterprise Admins and the user on the Azure AD side needs to have the global administrator role assigned
    
    - **Configuring Azure AD Dyamic groups**
        - Create a group and manually assign members
        - You can create **dynamic groups for users as well as devices**
        - Note that you can not contain users and devices in one group
        - Azure AD premium license is required for creating dynamic groups
        - It allows you to create special rules for particular groups of users and groups of devices

    - **Self Service Password reset**
      
        - The forgot my password system. Bypasses the IT an manual reset. This is self service
        - You can enable/turn on self service password reset for a particular account
        - You can enable it for a particulr group or all users
            - You can specify the authentication methods to allow the user to reset the password like
              - You can get to it by selecting the default directory, selecting password reset and then selecting athentication methods
                - Email, phone, app, security questions etc
        - You need Azure P1 or P2 premium license for this
        - You can manually assign P1/P2 license to a particular user

# Management and Security Solutions

## Azure Migrate Service
    - Migration of on premesis of workload on to Azure (Involves replication and testing of final migration)
    - Can work with Hyper-V or VMware or physical server
    
 - **Azure Site recovery service**
    - Within Azure, transfer from one region to another
    - It is a replication process (means 2 copies), the replication can be to physical servers or virtual machines
    - Tool: **Azure site recovery Vault**

- **Azure to Azure disaster recovery**
    - Azure continuesly replicates data onto a different target region
    - Source region: Create a storage account, which becomes the cache storage account, before transfer to the target region
    - New target resources created as a result of replication
        - Resource group
        - Virtual network
        - Storage account if there are unmanaged disks
        - Avilability set, if the availability set is present for the source, same for Availabilty zone-usually the same as the source

    - The recovery point retention (how long the recover services keep the recovery points) is 24hrs, the App-consistent snapshot is every 4hours

    - The traditional way can be first by creating a backup and then restoring from the backup - this process is slow and time consuming
    - **Continues replication** is different. All data is first sent to a **cache storage account** and then transferred to the target region disk storage (continues replication part), including disk storage for unmanaged disks in source. Once a retention point is established, you can conduct a fail point wich can then create a Vm in the destionation using the retention point
    - The purpose of a cache storage account is to ensure that nothing adverse happens to the source
    - During the replication process multiple **Retention Points** are created
    - Steps:
        1) Install Site Recovery Mobility Service Extension on source virtual machine
        2) Continues replication via cache storage account
        3) Creation of crash consistent and application consistent snapshots

    installing IAS on a VM, test VM
    selecting disaster recovery
    selecting a target region
     Created things
        - New VM, network, resource, cache storage account. The resource will be recovery service vault
        - Steps this process automatically performs: Check for enabling protection, installing mobility service, enable replication etc
    - You can conduct **test failover**. A new VM is created in the target region out of the replication VM usng a recovery point
    - You can click **cleanup test failover** to delete the recovery test failover machine

## Hyper V
- This relates more to on premesis network called Hyper V host- Switching from on premesis network to Azure
- You can simulate local premisis by creating a VM and then installing hyper V. you can also create VMs inside the VM - **Nested virtulization** - restriction on sizes
    - Steps include creating a VM
    - Installing hyper V
    - Creating a network adapter
    - creating VM wth nested virtulization inside the VM - Note that selecting the initial VM size here is important - the size must be large enough to support nested virtulization
- Azure assessment appliance, it is a VM that needs to be replicated
- Azure migrate service
- The goal is learn how to migrate 

- **Step 1:Setting up Hyper V to simulate local premesis** (Micosoft hyper V instructions)[]
    - Create VM and then RDP to it, launch powershell, install hyper V and then restart the machine after installation is complete. Note that here is the size of the VM where you are installing the hyper V is small then the hyper V installation command will not run
    - Powershell command: `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All`
    - The next command will be to create a new VM switch which can be used by the VMs - Its like creating a NAT which is like a subnet
    - Then next configure gateway for the switch, you have to specify the ip address

- **Step 2: Assessment Tool: Configuring Migrate in the Azure account and assesseng the hyperV VMs with and Assessment VM**
    - From the dashboard select Azure Migrate > Servers (from the left pannel migration goals)
        - Slect Add tool
            - Choose resource group and name
            - This will create a project in Azure migrate
        - Next go to Azure migrate server assessment
            - click discover
                - slect discover using an appliance
                - select the technology you used for virtulization, in this case you will select the option `yes, with hyper-V`
                - Download the VHD file with is a virtual machine called Azure migrate appliance 12GB - once downloaded with run it
        - Next on the hyperV VM upload this VM - what this does is create an assessment VM
        - If there are additional VMs running on the Hyper V, this assessment VM will then assess those VMs and send information to Azure migrate
    - Then from the hyper V start the newly uploaded assessment VM
        - Once inside the Assessment VM
            -Enable remote access - Can be done by right clicking on my computer and then under the remote
            - Then assign a static ip to the new VM installed
                - go to control pannel, network and internet > network and sharing center > change adapter settings > ethernet, properties > IPV4, properties - assign ip address based on NAT network e-g `20.0.0.4` you created before and likewise fill in the net mask, also assign the default gateway. 
                    - Also specify the google DNS server as default, but any DNS of your website will work as well
    - Once the VM has internet connectivity, the Azure migrate appliance will start to run on IE
        - COmplete pre-requisites, then the app will run some checks and install any update if necessary
        - Register the Assessment machine with Azure migrate by logging onto Azure from the same page, you maybe provided a code
            - Once logged in, choose subscription
            - give appliance name
            - register - this will register the appliance with the migrate project
            - Then connect to the hyperV VM - you will have to use its credentials not of the assessment VM
                - Under control panel > system and security > windows firewall
                    - Temporarily turn off the firewall in hyper V and the assessment VM for private network
            - Add hyper V hosts to the virtual machine from the assessment virtual machine
                 - On Azure in hyper V, you can get the private ip address and then paste it into thte box where it asks for "provide a list of hyper V hosts"
                 - Then save and start **discovery** - this will discover all the VMs in the hyper V through the assessment VM
            - Next from the Azure account you will then be able to navigate to **Azure Migrate** and in **Servers**. You can then see **Server Assessment** results. The server discovered will the server on which the server assessment tool is running
                - When you will see the name of the assessment machines. Any other guest machines on the hyper VM will also be detected if present
                - You can then generate an assessment by clicking **Assess Servers**
                - You can access the report by going back to servers (left pannel) from the Azure migrate and click overview - then you will be able to see the assessment report
                    - Mostly this assessment is a cost analysis and whether or not the on premesis workloads can be migrated to Azure

    - So the ultramini summary is as follows:
        - Create Hyper V
        - Download VHD- assessment VM
        - Register the Assessment VM with migrate project
        - Start discovery to detect all the VMs running on hyperV
        - Generating an Assessment report in Azure after the assessment has been carried out

- **Step 3: Migration Tool: Performig the actual migration after the Assessment is complete**
        - From the main dashboard, go to the Azure migrate and select server
            - Select `Azure Migrate: Server Migration tool`
            - Click add tool
            - Then click discover, select yes, Hyper V and select region > create resources
            - This creates a **Azure site recovery services vault** and can be accessed in Azure from the resources
                - This will require to download replication provider software (`azuresiterecoveryprovider.exe`) on Hyper V host, it also provides a key to be used to rgister the Hyper V host to the Azure migrate project. Note that you should download this file after logging into the Azure account from the Hyper V. Also download the `key file`
            - When you will run the **provider file on the hyper V and then also run the key file to register that hyper V with the Recovery Services Vault**
            - After this step is complete from Azure where you downloaded the files (under discover machines), click **finalize registeration** - this will become enabled some time after the registeration of hyper V with Azure is complete after you ran the provider/key files there
            - This step triggers the replication process
            - **Creating a new Vnet in Azure** After the registeration is complete - Create a new virtual network in Azure
                - Note the Ip address range, **use the same as the NAT network in hyper V** CDR range could vary
                - Also create a subnet (same address range as the NAT network), Subnet range should be the same
                - You can go to migration by selecting `Azure migrate` from the dashboard and then selecting `servers` from the left pannel under `migrating goals`
                    - Then you can click `overview`, and select `replicating machines` from the left pannel and then click `migrate`
                - Test migration - it has no public ip address. If you want to test it you will have to assigin a public ip address and an NSG
                    when the test migration is complete you will be able to view the results 
                - Final migration - go to Azure migrate  and then servers and then select migrate
            - **Cleanup test migration**
                - After navigating to migrate as above you can select `test migrate cleanup` type some notes like testing complete
                    - This deletes the test VM, can take 2-3 min
                    - You can verfy that the cleanup is complete by going to the virtual machine and you wont see the test migrate VM
                    - Click `stop replication` to complete - this disables the replication
                        - When this step is done, then under replicating machines, you will not see any items
                    - You can also **delete the registration of the hyper V** that you registered with the Azure account, as part of the cleanup
                        - You can delete the hyper V registeration under infrastructure servers
                    - You can also delete the Azure recovery services agent from the hyper V by going to the control pannel and then uninstalling `Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent`
                    - Likewise, also uninstall `Microsoft Azure Site revovery provider`
                    - Finally from Azure portal, you can delete the project by navigating to Azure Migrate and Servers
                        - Go to all resource, also check hidden resources
                        - Select the project by name, like "app-project", not that if you do not select show hidden types, you will not be able to see the Azure migrate project

    - **Using Azure Site Recovery Service**
        - This is an alternative to **Azure migration**, used on the local premesis hyper V. It is not the same as Azure migrate, but it can be used to transfer the VM/data to a new 
        - You need an Azure storage account for replicating the data
        - You will also have to create a target virtual network
        - Steps:
            - Create **Recovery service vault**
                - Go to dashboard and in resources type recovery and select `backup and site recovery` > create
                    - Assign resource group and vault name, select region
                    - Once the resource is created- you can check it out under resources
            - **Prepare infrastructure**- specify source/destination
                - Once you locate the resource, from the left pannel, select site recovery and click prepare infrastructure (this means downloading and installing `Recovery provider` on hyper V)
                - Log in to the Azure account from the hyper V and navigate to **site recovery** after selecting the recovery vault resource 
                    - You will have to fill:
                        - Protection goal: `location: On premesis`, `destination: to Azure`, `performing replication:yes`, `machines virtualized?:yes, Hyper V`, `using system center:no`
                        - Deployment planning: `yes I have done it`
                        - Source: `Add Hyper V name` e-g SiteA
                            - Next you have select `add server` to download Microsoft site recovery provider and run it on the hyper V machine
                                - This will install `Azure Site Recovery Provider agent` then run the wizard. It will ask for the key
                            - You can download the key file from the link below the recovery provider file where it says **vault registeration key** and then upload the key file into the wizard
                                - This will connect the hyper V to the recovery services vault on Azure
                    - Then you will have to create a storage account or link the subscription to a pre-exisitng storage account and create a virtual network (this is the target)
                    - You will also have to create a replication policy - this takes care of replication specifics such as copy frequency, recovery point retention - you can mostly keep defaults
            - **Enable a replication**
                - Navigate to the Azure site recovery services vault by selecting it from the resource dashboard and then selecting `site recovery` from the left pannel under getting started
                - Select Replicated items from the left pannel under protected items
                    - **Replicate** - click it
                        - Source: On-premesis, yes for performing a migration, check that you want to use Azure site recovery, select hyper V site
                        - Target: Select storage account and Virtual network if already created
                                    - Select the post-fail over network - This is where you actually link the network as the target
                        - virtual machines: check migrate. Once you complete this you will be prompted to select oS etc where you can pick windows. Select the replication policy. Then finally click Replicate
                        - This process will replicated the VM in the hyper V to a storage account
                        - When complete, under replicated items from the left pannel of the recovery service resoure you will see the migrate status as "healthy"
            - **Migrate**
                - After the replication is complete, you select that health migrate column from above and then you will have options for **planned failover, failover or test failover**
                    - Go ahed with a **test failover**
                        - From the left pannel after you click test failover, select `compute and network`, edit. You can select the size allocation for the VM |save
                        - go back to overview, you can choose a recovery point and the latest process revovery point assign the network
                        - Once the **Test migration** is complete, a notification will pop up, you can click it to inspect the results
                            - Under resources | virtual machines, you will now see a new VM called `Migrate-test` 
                                - Note that his VM will NOT have a **public ip address** or **NSG rules**
                                - Navigate to the Migrate-test VM and select networking from the left pannel
                                    - You can assign a public ip after selecting network interface and then selecting ip configuration under setting. Click associate and then create a new ip address
                                    - Then you can RDP to the VM. After logging in you will see `Azure migrate appliance congiguration manager` file on the desktop
                        - **clean-up**: Next navigate to Recovery services vault resource and select replicated items under protected items from the left pannel, click migrate and click **test failover cleanup**
                            - Next you can clean up the resources: navigate to the recovery servives valut resource, under replicated items, right click the 'migrate' and select **disable replication** select a reason. Once done, on refresh, you will no longer see the replication. 
                            - Likewise, you can navigate to the recovery vault and then under manage from the left pannel select **Site recovery infrastructure**
                                - There you can select **Hyper V hosts** from the left pannel and then select delete
                                - Finally likewise you can also delete the hyper-V site

## Azure Load Balancer
- Distribution of traffic load onto the virtual machines
    - requires configurations
        - Backend pool - The pool of VMs behind the load balancer
        - Front-end IP - This is the public ip address for the internet traffic
        - Health probe - Checks the health of VM before directing the users to a particular VM by the load balancer
        - Load balancing rules - Rules regarding the listening ports of the VMs, e-g traffic regarding port 80
- There are 2 `SKUs`, there are categories of load balancer based on features
        - **Basic** (Can place only a single VM behind a load balancer, availability set, scale set)
        - **Standard** - has more features (Can place Multiple virtual machines behind a load balancer, availability set, scale set)
        - Note that if you are using a load balancer the VMs must be part of the same availability set or a scale set
        - There are 2 types of load balancers: 
            - External (public- exposed to the internet)
            - Internal (Not exposed to public, for example between web VMs and database VMs)


- **Setting up a Load Balancer**:
    - `Create 2 VMs` as part of the same availability set
        - Select the image `windows server 2019 datacenter`, select region, size (8GB), administrator credentials etc, **enable port 80**
        - Create a new availability set and assign it to VM you are creating
            - Specify fault and update domains, 2 each
        - Also create a new virtual network while creating a VM
            - Be sure to **assign a public Ip address to the VM** - Note that here even though you are going to assign a public ip to the load balancer, but here you are associating a public ip address to the VM because you want to access internet information services and an HTML page. However, once the load balancer is created - this VM public ip address can be removed
            - When you create the second VM, be sure to include them in the same availability set, Vnet
    - Install internet information services on both VMs
        - Connect to the first VM by RDP
        - Server manager > Add roles and features > intallation types \ role based installation > Server roles \ check webserver/internet information services >> install
            - You can verify that the IIS is installed by pasting the public ip address on your lap top browser (not from inside the VM), if the page displays then yes
    - Place a simple `HTML page` as home page on both VMs, this is to help distinguish the to VMs to see if they are workig 
        - Create a new notepad file and past the only text h1-tag This is VM 1 h1-tag save the file in `Windows(C): > inetpub > wwwroot` This is where you can place this notepad file - this is a windows system folder that displays the default html page in a browser of that computer. You can name the file `default.html`- whatever you name it. That is what you will have to type in the browser next to the ip address. So in the browser it will be `public ip address/default.html`. Repeat the same for the second VM but in the HTML text you can say "This is VM 2"
    - Once you have tested that the html pages and the IIS are working in both the virtual machines, next you can **delete the public ip addresses** of both the VMs
        - You can do this by going the `VM resource || Settings \ Networking -> VM name next to network interface || Settings \ Ip configurations -> ipconfig1 -> Disassociate under Public IP address -> save` - can take 5 min to process. Do this for both VMs
    - **Create a `public ip` address** - this is for the load balancer
        - In general resources search for public ip address, select this `resource -> create | Name, static, choose subscription, resource group, location (must be same as VMs)`
            - At this time if you go to your 2 VMs you will see that neither will show to be having a public ip address
    - **Create a `load balancer resource`** - You can search it in resources from the main dashboard
        - Creating a load balancer
            - Assign resource group,name, region, SKU(know the difference b/w basic and standard- the basic option allows only one VM in backend pool )
            - In the public ip address, select use existing and specify the one that you just created
            - Rest leave as is
        - Assign a **public IP address** that you created - This is done above from the first page of creation - Can verify this by navigating to the `load balancer from resources || Front IP configuration` - there you will be able to see the assigned public IP. Note that once you assign the ip, this ip will also be automaticlly assigned to the VMs that are configured as the backend pool 
        - Add a **backend pool** of virtual machines (where you add the VMs that you have previously created)
            - `load balancer || Backend pool -> add, give a name, choose Vnet, associated to: VMs and then add the VMs you prevuously created`
        - Add a **health probe**
            - `load balancer || health probe -> add, give name, leave TCP, port 80, interval 5s, consecutive failures x2`
        - Add **load balancing rules** - The rule will define routing and spliting traffic towards the virtual machines
            - `load balancer || load balancing rule -> add,give name, protocol TCP, port 80, backend port 80, selct pool and health prob by name as you created above, rest as default`
            - This rule is essentially directing front-end requests to the load balancer to the backend pool which will also conduct a health probe prior to directing traffic
        - You can test whether the loadbalancer is working by pasting the public ip of the load balancer and /default.html, if its working then it will be able to display the html pages from the VMs

    - **Setting up the standard load balancer**
        - You can have independent virtual machines, but they must be part of the same Vnet
        - The process is similar to above:
            - creating Vnet with two VMs (allow port 80), installing IIS, html pages, then create a load balancer, assign it public ip address to the load balancer, health probe and load balancing rule
        - Key difference to note
            - When dissociating the public ip addresses of the VMs in the network interface card, be sure to select assignment for IP as **static** instead of dynamic under the ` navigate VM || networking || IP configurations ->ipconfig1 -> assignment->static`
            - When you create a new public ip address for the load balancer, be sure to select **standard** under SKU, select the subscription
            - Also select **standard** for the SKU when creating a load balancer
            - Note that for Standard SKU an NSG will need to be created that has a white list of ips. In contrast, creation of NSG is optional for basic SKU, but required for standard
            - Likewise, add backend pool and add the VMs to the pool. Subsequently add a health probe like before as well as the load balancing rule
            - Rest is same as above
            

## Azure Application Gateway
- Components
    - Frontend IP address
    - Listner (x2 types: basic-listens to a single domain site, multisite- listens to multiple domain sites )
    - Routing rules - Route listner traffic from listner to the backend pool
        - x2 types: - Basic- all requests routed to backend pool directly, path-based - Requests are routed to the backend pool based on URL
                    - Path-based - Requests are routed based on the URL
    - Backend pools - Can be many things like Network interface cards, VM scale sets, IP addresses, backends such as App service


- **Creating application gateway**
- Create 2 VMS and install internet information services. One for the purpose of processing videos, the other for processing images
    - Use the standard way, allow port 80 and keep public ip
        - create a new virtual network along with the VM - the ip for the VM should be /16, and for the subnet /24
        - Note that an empty subnet must be created to host the application services
        - Likewise create the second virtual machine and select the network that you just created
    - RDP to the VMs
        - From server dashboard `-> Add roles and features > server roles, check web server IIS` and then install. 
        - Create a notepad file for html.` C:> inetpub > wwwroot> here create a new folder videos > default.html` Now if you go and type the `ip address/videos/default.html` you will be able to see the html page
        - You can then repeat the same step on the second VM and create the folder `images` instead of videos
- Create Azure application gateway and implement URL pathways routing
    - Search for this resource by typing **application gateway** from the dashboard
    - **Setting up application gateway**
    - **Basics** tab
        - Tier Standard V2
        - You can select autoscaling, this will scale based on the demand, for now you can select no
        - Availability zone, none
        - Go inside the virtual network resource that you created before and in addition to the default subnet, **add a new application subnet /24**. Note that this new subnet must be an empty subnet. An empty subnet is a requirement for application gateway
    - **Frontend** tab    
        - Next under the `front-end tab` - add a public ip address (you can assign a private ip address if you want to keep the application gateway as an internal resource)
    - **Backend** tab
        - Add VMs to the backend pool. Note that there are 2 VMs one for video and the other for images
            - Once you are in the `backends` tab click `add backend pool`
                - Give name e-g `imagepool` or `videopool`
                - Target type: select virtual machine and then select VM by name. Note that you can check the name of the VM from going to the resources
    - **Configuration**
        - This includes creating the **routing rules** that govern when a request comes to the frontend it gets routed to the appropriate backend pool
        - Select add routing rule
            - Give rule name, listener name
- Add the VMs to the backend pool

- **Web application firewall**
    - Its an additional feature that you can add to the azure application gateway
        - You can create policy and custom rules and then associate them to an application gateway

- Note that the load balancer operates in layer 4, the network layer, while the application gateway operated in layer 7


## Azure traffic manager
- DNS based traffic load balancer
        - **Priority** - Shifts to the next endpoint after the first one fails
        - **Weighted** - Distribute traffic based on weightage
        - **Performance** - The traffic is directed based on the closest endpoint
        - **Geographic** - Traffic directed based on the location
        - **Multivalue** - The user selects the endpoint
        - **Subnet** - IP addresses are allocated to a specific subnet
- Using VS code to publish webapps on Azure

Traffic manager profile from resources
    - You also have to configure the traffic manager to see is the endpoints are healthy

- Real user measurements when using Azure traffic manager - it is based on performance routing method - which is based on least latency

`Circle back to Azure traffic manager using azure webapps 181-185`

## Azure Front Door service
- Routes traffic based on application performance
- Features
    -URL based routing
    - It inspects the URL and then directs the request to one set of server
- **Setting up Front Door Service**
    - Search for **Front door** in resources in the main dashboard and click create
        - **Basics tab**
            - Choose the resource or create new, and assign the subscription
        - **Configuration tab**
            - Add a `front end host`
                - give a hostname
                - You can enable session affinity - This allows cookies for a use for subsequent visit
                - You can enable application firewall - offers centralized protection for web applications
            - Add a `backend pool` - this is our end point (s)
                - End points are typically the destination for a user like a service or web application
                    - Give a backend pool name
                    - Add a backend pool
                        - Backend host type - various options like app service, storage account, application gateway, ip address, in this case you can      choose app service
                        - backend hostname - you can select the hostname that you previously created while creating the apps
                        - backend header - specific appliations will now show after you select a particular app
                        - HTTP port - 80 usually
                        - HTTPS port - 443 usually
                        - Priority - 1 will be the first priority
                        - weight - 50% the traffic is distributed equally, if you select 100% all traffic will go to the app you selected
            - Likewise you can add additional backend
                - you can set the priority to 2 and keep the weight at 100%. This will ensure that if the first app is down, 100% of the traffic will then get directed to the second
            - You can also configure the health probs for backend pool to periodically check the health of endpoints before the traffic is directed
                - You can specify the path as `/` and the interval to `30s`, specify protocol http or https
            - Add a `Routing rule` - If a user visits the frontend direct them to a specific backend pool
                - Specify a name 
                - specify the front end domain that the user visits when this rule will be applied
                - Then you can specify the path if you select `/*` it means request from any path will be directed to the backend pool
                - you can specify the protocol
            - Once the front door resource is created, go to the resource
                - paste the front end url into the browser - note that initially from creation when the front end is being created, initially it may give an error page as it will be tesing the endpoints with a health probe
    - In contrast with Azure application gateway, Azure Front door is a combination of azure application gateway and the Azure traffic manager
        - Front door is a global rwsource while application gateway is a regional source (attached to a virtual network as it requires an empty subnet)
        - Front door does not require any empty subnet or attachment to a virtual network
        - You can use the front door and application level together by placing the application gateway behind the front door
    
## Azure frewall
    - Placed in front of data centers
    - Azure has its own managed service - protecting VMs that are part of virtual network
    - Its different than NSG
    - Features:
        - Can deploy across multiple availability zones
        - Filter traffic based on domain names (not available with NSG)
        - Can create network filtering rules based on source and destination Ip addresses
        - oversees packets of data and which ones to allow
        - Built in threat intelligence - You can get alerts or deny service to particular suspicous traffic - Azure firewall already knows about it
 - **Setting up a firewall**
    - Find a new VM from resources
        - Create new resource
        - usual things, give a name. RDP
        - `Do not allow any inbound ports` as the communication will be done via private IP addresses
        - Along with the VM create a new virtual newtork
            - give a name
            - /16 address range
            - SubnetA /24
            - `AzureFirewallSubnet`Note that this name should be exactly so. This is an additional subnet that is being created to host the Azure firewall feature
            - No public IP
            - Remainder tabs as is
    - Once you have created a VM and a Vnet containing an `AzureFirewallSubnet`, **create a firewall**
        - search firewall from general resources
        - assign the resource group you created for the VM above
        - give name
        - select firewall tier as standard (premium has more features)
        - You can select use `classic` rules to manage the firewall
        - Select the virtual network you selected above
        - The firewall must have a public ip address, as you did not assign a public ip address previously, you will have to create one now
        - Rest as is
        - Note that the Azure firewall has both a public as well as a private ip address. The private ip is used for any communication between the Vm/Subnet and firewall
    - Connecting to the firewall
        - **Creating a route table**
            - The purpose is to design a route rule such that when even a VM wants to access the internet(`0.0.0.0/0`), it is directed to the firewall
            - Search for the route table from general reources
            - Give a name, select a resource group, select a region (same as the Vnet)
            - Give a name for a route such as "firewallreoute" Select `yes` for `propagate gateway routes`
            - Then you can navigate to the resource and `firewallroute || routes > add > route name, address prefix (0.0.0.0/0), virtual appliance, hop address (private ip of the firwall)` >
            - Next you have to associate the subnet to the firewall route
                - Once you have selected the "firewallroute" resource `|| subnets > associate subnet > select the Vnet and the subnetA(that contains the VM)`
        - **Using the NAT feature available for the Azure firewall**
            - Go to the firewall resource `|| Rules > NAT rule collection > add NAT rule collection`
                - Givve name, assign priority, select protocol TCP, give sourve IP address (ip of your laptop), the destination is the public ip address of the firewall, destination ports 4000 (can be any), Network address translation (NAT)- the translated address is the private IP of the VM in Vnet, the translated port will be 3389 as this is the port for RDP. Note that if you have multiple VMs, the destination port will vary
        - Next to RDP you will then type in the public IP address of the firewall to get to the VM followed by : and the port number
        - **Add Rule** to permit opening of a particular website over the internet. 
            - Select the firewall resource `|| rules > Add NAT rule collection > Application rule collection`
                - Enter rule name, the source ip address now is the private IP of the VM, give it a name, specify http, https as protocols, and the name of the website you want to give permission
        
    ## Role based access control
    - Important reference: [Azure Built-in Roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles)
    - There are built in roles, you can also create your own custom roles
    - Roles can be assigned at the reource level, resource group level or even a subscription, Everything that is included under the resource will inherit the roles
    - Things that can be under a particular resource include a virtual machine and storage account
    - Roles are basically JSON format based action permissions
        - You can define scopes, data actions
        - If 2 roles are assigned e-g read and another as contributor, then the permissions of the higher level role will stick for example the contributor
    - Some examples of built in roles
        - Owner - Everything including the access to resources
        - Contributor - Evrything except access to resources
        - Reader
        - Storage account contributor
        - logic app reader
        - Security read
        - Security Admin
        - If there is a * after the role, for example in contributer role you can create storage accounts. If you see a * in the end it means that all the permissible actions with that job. If its something like */read, Then you can have access to all the jobs, but the action is limited to read only
    - **Access control for a VM**
        - Note that the access is managed in layers. If you give a user access to the VM as a contributor, this user will not have access to the network and the disk, as they are separate resources and if you want to grat the user access to these components as well then you will either have to the user individually at the disk or network level individually by going to these resources or you can grant the user access to the common resource group all these individual layers of resources share
    - **Creating a custom role**
        - Add a custom rile
        - You can clone an existing role
        - You can also start with a JSON
        - You can searh role functions by category like 'compute'

## Azure Policy service
    - You can apply restrictions on how big the VM can be and that and anti-malware is installed on every machine, or every resource group has a resource in place
    - You can access the policies by searching in main dashboard | Policy
    - You can select policy details by category, e-g policies related to computing, which will include policies like limiting the VM size and the installation of anti-malware
    - Like wise you can apply the policy levels at the resource group etc
    - You can also check to which VMs the policy is not applied or are (non-compliant)
        - Note that the policy does not remove the machines that are not compliant - you will have to manually fix it
        - However you can select a policy that applies the default antimalware extension if it does not exist
        - You can inspect the VM under || extension to see whether a policy has been applied. You can also delete an applied policy

## Azure Blueprints
    - Managing the deployment of resources on Azure with code
    - This can be done for:
        - ARM templates
        - Azure policies
        - Resource groups
        - Role based access control
    - The above categories can be assigned as "artifacts"
    - You create a blue print and then assign it to a subscription or a management group, but it cannot be a part of a resource group
        - This is different from ARM templete which is infrastructure as code
        - Stages: Defining, publishing and assigning
        - You can also apply locks to the blue print that even a user with owner level access can not change
            - The lock can only be removed by unassigning the blueprint
- **Creating a blue print**
    - You can searh it from the general dashboard
    - Click create a blue print - you can also pick from a sample
    - you will have to select a management group. If there is none already, there is always a default tenant group
    - First you creat a blue print and select artifacts to be included in it. Then you publish the blue print once the artifacts are added and finally you can assign them
        - Assignment is to a subscription. You can also always unassign, however the resources that were initially created when the blue print was first assigned do not get deleted

# Azure web application as service
 - or Platform as a service (Paas). Payment options: [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/windows/)
 - If an application is developed using .Net, Java, Ruby, Node.js, python - it can be deployed using the Azure app service
        - Azure app service takes care of all the deployment aspect including deployment of infrastructure, autoscaling and security features
- You can want full control of your application then you can do it manually by deploying on the VM yourself
- Web app should be linked in the app service plan
- Examples of plans
    - Free plan, limitations on CPU minutes/day, number of application and size, abscence of scaling
    - Basic has unlimied applications and auto scaling features - if overloaded then there can be up to 3 instances of the application - This distributes application load over multiple VMs
- **Creating a web application**
    - you can select **Web app** from the main resources page
        - You give a name. The name is appended with the `.azurewebsite.net`
        - If you have you own domain you can map it instead of the default of `.azurewebsite.net`
        - The web app service manages the entire underlying infrastructure
        - For having the feature of backup the app service plan should be standard or higher
        - You need a different app service plan if your code is run on linux

## Linknig github with Azure account
- Under `app services | select your app and then || Deployment center -> select github`
- Deployment options include: 
    - App service build service
        - Picks up the code from github and turns it into an application
    - github, azure piplines
    - If you make changes on github, it automatically gets implement onto Azure via the github connection

## Azure Web Jobs
- Running background tasks, e-g running scripts in powershell or python etc
- 2 types: 
    - Continues - The code contains endless loop, supports remote debugging
    - Triggered - Based on schedule or is initiaed manually
- **Uploading a webjob**
    - You can go to the main dshbord find web jobs and then you an Add one
    - Type the name
    - upload the file - note that the file must be in zip format
    - Under `triggers` you can select scheduled r manual
    - Under cron expression you can specify the frequency if you have chosen scheduled - how often you want to run the file
    - Once the webjob has been created, it will appear under webjobs and you can manually run it by clicking `run`
    - To check whether the job was run successfully, you can click `logs` it will show the status of success if the job was run successfully
    - You can also run diagnostics to see if the job was run successfully
    - Under App services, you can also setup app service logs. Options:
        - Webserver logging
        - Application logging
        - Quota (size limit)
        - Retention period for logs
    
## Auto Scaling
    - Part of standard app service plan and higher
    - This is a practice to address overload. In basic you can scale up to 3 VMs
    - Scaling can also happen automatically - included in standard
    - Create a condition based on CPU usage as to when to expand the number of VMs
- You can manage the scaling option by going to `App services || Scale out > Instance count`
- You can also scale up the service plan by selecting `scale up` then you can select auto scale which will permit an increase up to 10 instances compared to 3 instances with the basic plan
- You can check which plan you currently have by going to the default page of your app under `App service plan` S1 for standard
- **Custom auto scaling** gives you an option of setting the conditions for autoscaling
    - You create a scale rule
    - CPU percentage of app service plan
    - Other metric options
        - e-g Metric of memory percentage - It will take the metric over the last 10 min and take average and then match it with the threshold
    - There is also a cooling period
        - This is the time during which the load is being distrubuted across the VMs. you can specify the cooling period. During this time no additional upscaling will occur even if the threshold for upscaling is met
    - You can click `run history` to see how many times the upscaling occured. For example if it ran twice, it will show 2 and which means that there will be 3 VMs

## Deployment slots
- Seprate slots for production and staging slots
- Each slot has its own host name
- Allows you to test both versions independently
- You can also `swap` the slots - This minimizes the downtime. You can use the swap feature multiple time to go back and forth between the new as well as the old version
- This feature is available is available in standard app plan or higher
- You can access that by selecting `App services || Deployment slots > Add slot`
    - What this does is allocats a unique DNS name/host name which makes the new slot independent from an existing one
    - You can also clone the settings of an exisitng webapp
- **Application insights** in a feature that can be used to see how the application is running
    - Select the application from the dashboard and then `|| Application insights` under the settings heading
    - You can turn on application insights after you have deployed the appliation
    - This creates an application insights resource - that is where you can access it. You can also search for it by typing "insights" in the main resource dashboard
    - You can look at charts for the performance

## Integration of and Azure Webapp with an Azure virtual network
- Usually this means linkning the database webservers witht he appliation
- Steps
    - Create a web App and configure it
    - Create a new empty Virtual network
    - After both have been creted, you can then select the newly created app and select `|| Networking ` to configure linking the database network with the app
    - Add a VM to the network and install SQL server 2019 server image on it. Note that you will not be able to use the default subnet with it as it will be used by the Azure Web app. So you can create a new subnet calling it the database subnet
        - **SQL server settings** You will have the option of SQL server connectivity - you can choose public(internet) or any other option
    - Note that for the Azure web app to connect to the database server, there has to be some public connection. Ideally, this should be with with public IP to the Vnet and through Vnet a private IP to the database server VM

## Azure Functions
- Serveless - enables you to not worry about an underling infrastructure. Goal is to provide a serverless infrastructure
- Plans: Consumption (pay for the time the code is run), App service (If you are using a pre-exising web app service, then you can run functions with the same plan) and premium plan options
- you can search for the Azure functions by typing `function app` in the general resource dashboard
    - **Creating an Azure function**
        - Select resource name
        - Give function name - It will be appended by the Azurewebsites.net
        - You can publish a code or a docker container
        - Select the programing language such as Node.JS
        - Select the Storage account or create new and select the operating system and the plan
        - This is like creating a mini function app
        - Once the function app is created you can start developing the functions
            - Select the app `|| functions under functions > add`
            - Select develope in the portal
            - Specify trigger type e-g http, which means that the function will triger when an http request is received
        - You can also click get URL to get the link that you can paste in the browser to run the function
- Azure functions can be useful because they can allow you to compartmalize the code based on individual functional components of the app. For example for an E-comerse app you can create individual Azure functions for adding a product, processing orders, displaying orders and emailing orders etc 
- It also offers you the benifit of having an application in one programing service (e-g Node.JS) and Azure function in another e-g powershell

## Azure logic app
- Allows you to schedule, automate and orchestrate tasks
    - Logic + workflow
- Offers built in connectors that can connect to platforms such as Office 365
- There are built in templates that you can use
- **Event Grid** it is an Azure service that listens to the events from other Azure services
- Steps:
    - **Create logic**
        - Search for `logic app` in general resources
            - give name, select resource group, select location
            - you can keep the log analytics off
    - Build workflow (Configuring the trigger of a particular task)
    
## Azure Service Bus
- Message service system (FIFO - first in first out message delivery)
- Types : Publisher-Consumer messaging Ques, Topic service (e-g messages to subscribers)
- Basic and standard pricing - standard also lets you create topics which basic does not
- **Creating Service Bus**
    - You can search for `service bus` in the resources
        - When you create a service bus, you also create a `name space` within which you will create a name que
        - Once the Service bus is created you can go to the resource and for configuration `|| queues, topics under entities`
            - Add a queue- various specifications
                - specify the duration of the message stays - there are various default settings
            - Likewise you can create a topic and specify the default settings
                - you can add subscriptions to it
                - You can create multiple subscriptions to which the users can be subscribed and then you can send messages to multiple subscriptions


## Dockers and Containers
- The flow is like this:
    - Hyper V -> VM -> Container -> Application
    - Both the VM and the container have their own OS.
    - The OS of the container is the bare minimum required to run an application and thus is very much reduced in size (like 150mb vs 1GB of a VM)
    - The container OS also has its own port, for example port 80. You can map the port of the container with the port of the VM
    - This is very effective at reducing memory resources
    - Docker is the software that hosts the program for running the containers - but a container has its own OS, multiple containers inside docker can haver different OS
    - Inside the containers you can install various 'docker images" or packages
- **Using Docker**
    - Create a new linux VM
    - If you want to use internet on the container then add an inbound security rule in Azure VM to allow to keep port 80 open
- **Deploying an application on a container**
    - 
- **Azure container registery**
    - The immage for a container can be published in the form of code with Azure container registery
    - Once you create an image on a linux machine, it can be pushed onto Azure container registery and when new VMs are created the image can be downloaded using the Azure CLI commands
        - In general resources find container registery > create
        - Once created, go to the resource and || repositories under services
        - Run commands on the linux VM 
- **Azure container instances**
    - It can have its own ip address and a fully qualified domain name, you can specify ports as well
    - Search for a new resource Container instance from general resources
    - You can reference image sources from container registery
- **Azure web app based on containers**
    - Create a new webap
    - Open the app in the new tab by clicking the link from the dashboard of the Azure webap

## Azure Kubernetes
 - Managing the VMs hosting multiple/high load containers
    - Master Kuberneters cluster - Install the master on a VM
    - You create nodes `kubectl`
    - Functions:
        - Load balance and distribute network traffic over the conatiners
        - Restart containers when they fail
        - Replace or kill containers
        - Can be used to manage passwords, OAuth tokens and ssh keys
    - Create `Kubernetes cluster` from resources
    - Alternatively you can also create a cluster using CLI. You also install the `kubectl` tool
    - Service principal - Connecting Azure kubernetes to the Azure container registery - you can do the directly
- You can deploy `app programs` in yml files. These files contain code that specifies what you as looking to install. It is look for the image in the docker hub or Azure container registery and then deploy that image onto the container. You can also manage specific container settings such as specifying thecontainer port
- You can also have specific files where you can simply configure for a `service`, such as a load balancer
- You can upload the code yml files into the Azure powershell and execute the code
- You can also fetch information about a container using kuberneties
- You can delete the services and the deoployment with commands


# Azure Implementation and Managment of Data Platforms
- Platform as a service Paas
- You dont have to worry about backup patching or management of VMs, availability solution - Paas takes care of it
- Single database, management instance, elastic pool (all databases share the resources)
- Benifits of the conventional approach
    - You can migrate your on premesis datbase to Azure
     - You can have a private Ip address like you would have with a VM
- **Azure SQL Server**
    - Note that this is a public resource and can be less secure
    - 99.99% availability gauranteed
    - Has built in backup, patching, advanced intelligence and security features
    - Two models : 
        - **DTU** (Database transaction unit) - Basic, standard and premium - computing is managed by Azure
        - **vCore-based** - Independently scale and compute storage, choose different tiers, Azure hybrid benifit, cost saving if you have SQL server licenses
            - vCore has `Managed Instance Offer` that makes it easy to migrate from on premesis to Azure server, also permits integration with a virtual network
## Azure SQL as database service
- **Deploying an SQL resource**
    - Find SQL database form resources in the main dashboard
    - **Creating an SQL database**
        - Assign a resource group
        - Give a database neame
        - Select a server - This is managed by Azure
            - `Create a new server`
                - Provide name and login information, location
                - When you will provide a name it will get appended with `.database.windows.net`
                - the credentials you provide are will be used to log into th databae server
        - Then you can select whether to incluse the database as part of elastic pool (no for now)
        - Then it can select the size of the database (default selection Gen5, 2 vCores 32 GB)
            - `configure database`
                - You can look at the estimated cost per month - for this one it is $380/month, and select varous options of standard/basic/ premium etc
        - Under **networking tab**
            - Default is `no access` - the database is typically behind a firewall
            - You can add a public Ip address of your laptop by selecting public endpoint
        - Under additional settings
            - You can select `sample` if you are using existing (this option creates a sample database with a default set of tables in the database). There are also options for backup or starting with a blank database
        - From the SQL resource page, you can select `set server firewall` to allow access for additional client ip addresses

- **SQL server management studio**
    - It is a software that you can install on your computer for the management of the SQL database server from your computer. You will have to input the server name and the credentials required to login

- **Azure SQL query editor**
    - The best way to manage the SQL database is via the SQL server management studio - This is only an additional feature
    - You can select a pre-created SQL database and `|| query editor`
    - Login with credentials
    - This is where you can enter the code for SQL tables

- **Elastic pool**
    - You can include SQL databases into an elastic pool
    - It is for handeling scaling up and down of database DTUs based on the load
    - Avoids interruption compared to when individual databse is managed individually
    - Ensures efficient distribution of resources to the databases
    - Cost- effective
    - The databases on an elastic pool must be on a single server
    - eDTU - e for elastic
        - **Adding databases to elastic pool**
            - Create a new database along with the server
            - create a new elastic pool during the creation a new sql database
            - Configure compute and storage - **configure elastic pool**
                - select eDTU- basic, standard, premium
            - Once created you can go to the new database created and from the main page click the link next to the server name and then you will be able to see the SQL elastic pool. Once selected, you can click `configure`
                - Under the databases table you will see the option to `add databases`. You can also remove databases from the elastic pool. 
- **Azure SQL managed Instance**
- Offers additional features
    - 100% compatability
    - native Vnet implementation - It is launched in its own network
    - Note that this is different from Azure SQL server which is public, but Azure SQL managed instance in more secure, can can have its own Vnet
    - **Creating Azure SQL managed instance**
        - Search SQL managed instance form the main resources and create a new one
        - Give name, region, and configure
        - No DTUs, no low cost option
        - Specify computer specs
        - You can select locally redundant backup
        - You can get a discount if you already have an SQL server license
        - More complex password requirements
        - Takes about 6 hrs to complete
    - **Connecting to Azure SQL managed instance**
        - What you do is create a new VM and install SQL server managed studio on it and then connect it to the virtual network of the managed instance
        - When you create the new VM, be sure that it is part of the Vnet of the managed instance
        - This new Vm will need its own new subnet which is different from the default subnet that was created from the SQL managed instance
            - While **creating the VM**, `under subnet > manage subnet configuration`
            - Add a new subnet
                - Give a name subnetA, leave rest as is
        - Then rdp into the VM
            - Install SQL server management studio
            - Go to the managed instance an copy the host name
            - Past this information into the SQL server managener studio, and enter the credentials
            - Once logged in, you will see SQL server agent which is part of the SQL managed instance
- **Elastic/Server side transactions**
    - Data from one trnsaction is stored in multiple databases
    - The databases can be on the same server, on different servers or on Azure SQL managed instance

- **Azure SQL - Active geo-replication**
 - A secondary database created from a primary database which can be located on the same server, but is not managed by Azure SQL managed instance
    - It is a feature that can be enabled - when it is enabled, it continuesly replicates data from the primary database and creates a secondary database
    - The geo-replication secondary database is read only
    - One application is to minimize load on the actual app, by using the secondary database you can minimize queries to the primary database and the application
    - Another use is when there is failure of the primary database then you can use the secondary
- **Creating a geo-replication database from the primary**
    - Create the primary database and link it with the SQL server management studio
    - Access the primary database through the studio and run a query that creates a table and insert data into it for example
    - In Azure selecting the primary database homepage `|| geo-replication under settings`
        - Configure
            - choose region - does not have to be the same region as the primary
            - You will have to configure a new target server
                - Give the name for secondary server, specify login credentials
            - Elastic pool as none and select the pricing tier
        - So the configuration will create a new server and then replicate the primary database to a secondary database that is only readable
        - Then when you go to the SQL database in reseources, you will not be able to see the new secondary database
            - Open this reseource and then `add firewall > add client ip` - this creates a rule to allow my laptop Ip address to connect to the database
        - Copy the servername (note that this will be tied to the DNS `.database.windows.net`)
        - Register the secondary database with the SQL database management studio using this name and the credentials
        - After registering the new one you will then be able to see both the primary as well as secondary database
        - Insert a new row of data into the primary via right clicking the table and clicking `new query`
        - Then in the secondary database you will see that the new data was copied
        - You can stop the secondary replication from the Azure home page - this does not delete the dataabse - this will need to be deleted manually along wit the server from Azure resourses separately

- **Auto-failover groups in Azure SQL server**
- This feature is more applicable in the case of disaster recovery scenarios
- This is in addion to the geo-replication
- This feature is available at the SQL server level and is also included in the Azure SQL managed instance
- It allows you to replicate multiple databases on a server and the process can be automated
- Unlike geo-location, the auto-fail over must be performed in a different region
- **Creating a failover group**
    - Go to the database resource homepage `|| failover group > create `
        - give name, condigure settings - this will include creating a new server and selecting the new region, you can select the failover the policy to be automatic. You can select specifc databases 


## Azure Cosmos DB
- Fast response time, hifh scalablity, automatic updates and patching
- Underlying API
    - SQL - store in JSON documents
    - MongoDB -JSON documents
    - Gremlin API- graph based
    - Apache Cacandra
    - Table API - key value pairs
- **Creating a Cosmos DB account**
- There are no underlying infrastructure costs, You care charged based on the throuput (request units) you provision and the storage consumed on an hourly basis. The Memory and the CPU are assigned based on the throughput selected
    - Search for cosmos DB from general resources
        - Select resource group
        - Account name
        - Select API type for example core SQL or MongoDB - Note that core SQL here has the benifit of `using SQL based commands, but the data is stored in JSON format`. It also has the added benifit of of using `dot notation` with the command to extract specific objects
        - Free tier account fives 400 request units/s and 5Gb of free space
        - account type non-production
        - Rest as is
    - Go to the resource once the deployment is complete
- Once an account has been created, **create a new container** from `|| Data Explorer`
    - Give a name
    - Then you specify the **throughput** which is the limit of request units, if you select 400, you will be paying $23.04. Do not confuse this with storage, this falls in the relm of computing
- Give your container a name. 
- Specify partition key, it can be existing variable
- Then once you create a continer, you can open it into a separate window to configure or look at its contents/items
    - you can **add a new item** by clicking it
    - This item can be some data in a json format, which is thus basically data stored in the form of an object in JSON format. It will have an id and a partition key
- Note that the data in Cosmos DB is split into multiple logical partitions and these logical partitions are stored in different physical partitions
