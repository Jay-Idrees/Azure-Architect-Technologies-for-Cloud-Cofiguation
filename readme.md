# Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies for Cloud 

I have created this repository as my go-to self reference for Azure Architecht technologies certifications

## Powershell

- It is a command line interface for administrating Azure environment

- **Azure PowerShell** is an extended version of Microsoft-extended Powershel - Allows you to interact with Azure Environment via **Azure Modules**. These azure modules are a set of commands that configure a certain task such as configuring a virtual network, subnet etc. The convenience is that you can run a specific Azure Module through powershell and it will automatically configure it. 

- The requirements for installing Azure Powershell is that you have the latest versions of win basic powershell and .NET Framework- See below to check which versions you have

- Check which default version is available for powershell in windows by opening it and typing `$PSVersionTable` in the terminal. This commands give a bunch of details. You can be even more specific with `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`. Keep powershell up to date- current version is 5.1. If you need to install use [Latest Powershell version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.1#powershell-core)

- You should also have the updated version of **.NETframework** - It is a webapp framework that is used to build online software. You can use powershell to check the version with the following commnd:

- `(Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full").Release -ge 394802`  where `-ge` is greater than or equal to. This is like going to the registry with `regedit` and then navigating to the path and locating the version. 394802 corresponds with .NET Framework version 4.6.2 or later and is the release key. Each version has its own release key, for example 528040 is the release key for .NET Framework 4.8. A version of 4.72 or later is preferred. If you need to install use [Latest .NET framework version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/)

- Below are the comparison operators in powershell

- `-eq`	Equal
- `-ne`	Not Equal
- `-gt`	Greater than
- `-ge`	Greater than or equal to
- `-lt`	Less than
- `-le`	Less than or equal to
- `-like`	Checks if part of string matches (Wildcard comparison)
- `-notlike`	Checks if part of a string doesn’t matches (Wildcard comparison)
- `-match`	RegEx comparison
- `-notmatch`	RegEx comparison
- `-contains`	Containment Operator
- `-notcontains`	Non-Containment Operator
- `-In`	In Operator
- `-notIn`	Non In Operator
- `-Replace`	Replaces a string pattern
