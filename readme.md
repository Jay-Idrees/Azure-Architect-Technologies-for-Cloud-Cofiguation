I have created this repository as my go-to self reference for Azure Architecht technologies certifications

## Powershell

- It is a command line interface for administrating Azure environment

- **Azure Powershell** is an extended version of Microsoft-extended Powershel. It includes **Azure Modules**. These azure modules are a set of commands that configure a certain task such as configuring a virtual network, subnet etc. The convenience is that you can run a specific Azure Module through powershell and it will automatically configure it. 

- Check which default version is available for powershell in windows by opening it and typing `$PSVersionTable` in the terminal. This commands give a bunch of details. You can be even more specific with `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`
